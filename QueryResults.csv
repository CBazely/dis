<p>The problem must obviously be in this method, in my opinion, the code is not exiting from the while true loop, and i just can't see why. This problem has to be tackled using the Newton Raphson method only to approximate the square root. Could it be maybe since the newton raphson equation doesn't have brackets?</p>

<p>It's true, you can't see it. All the time I'm looking in the refrigerator <em>at the milk</em> and I can't see the milk.  You have Refrigerator Blindness but for coding. You are looking directly at an obvious defect and you cannot see it.</p>

<p><strong>This problem is very, very common amongst both beginners and experienced programmers.</strong></p>

<p>It's also very common amongst humans. You have a bias towards reading what you think is there, even when it is not:</p>

<pre><code>           /\
          /I \
         /LOVE\
        /PARIS \
       / IN THE \
      /THE SPRING\
     --------------
</code></pre>

<p>The first time they read it, most people read ""<em>I love Paris in the spring</em>"", but <em>that's not what it says</em>.</p>

<p>The program you are analyzing in your head is the one that works, but that program only exists in your head. You have to analyze the program that you actually wrote and is actually running!  This is essentially a form of <em>confirmation bias</em> -- the tendency to observe evidence that supports your wrong belief that the code is correct, and fail to see evidence that contradicts it.</p>

<p>There are many techniques that experienced developers use every day to break out of code blindness and find the defect.</p>

<p>The technique you're using is <em>ask people with fresh eyes to look at the problem</em>. This technique works; I just had to glance at your code to see the obvious problem because <em>I'm reading the code that you wrote</em>, and you're reading <em>the code that doesn't exist that you thought you wrote</em>.  </p>

<p>But that's a bad technique because it wastes other people's time on trivial problems that you could learn to solve yourself. <strong>Today would be a great day to learn how to solve those problems yourself.</strong></p>

<p>The first technique is to <em>learn how to use a debugger</em>.  </p>

<p>What you want to do is step through the code in the debugger, one statement at a time, and on every statement make a prediction about what that statement will do. <strong>You have to make the prediction before you step the statement</strong>.  Then step the statement and see if your prediction came true. Eventually you'll make a prediction that is false, and that's the point where your understanding of your program is wrong.</p>

<p>This works for our optical illusion as well. If you tell people to read a word, pause, and read the next word, it becomes easy to see the error.</p>

<p>The next technique is called <em>rubber duck debugging</em>.  </p>

<p>Get a rubber duck or a grad student or some other object you can talk to, and <strong>out loud</strong> explain every line of your program -- preferably while debugging -- and give an <em>excessively detailed</em> explanation of why that line is correct.  When you get to a line you cannot justify, either you don't understand your own program, or the line is wrong.  </p>

<p>You will feel like an idiot talking out loud to a rubber duck, but part of what makes it work is engaging the part of your brain responsible for speaking.  And again, this works for our illusion: if you read every word and say the sentence out loud, instead of reading the whole sentence and then saying the whole sentence, the error becomes obvious.</p>

<p>In particular, <em>explain the purpose and usage of every variable very carefully</em>. In your case that alone would quickly find the problem, as you have a variable which is declared and written but never read. A variable which is written but never read from is a <strong>huge</strong> red flag; it means that you've either got a useless part in your machine, or, more likely, you've got a crucial part that is not being used by mistake.  As is the case here.</p>

<p>In your particular case there are some special techniques.  </p>

<ul>
<li><p>Your intuition gave you two big hints: the problem is an infinite loop, and ""Could it be maybe since the newton raphson equation doesn't have brackets?"" The first intuition was spot on. The second intuition makes zero sense to me and I have no idea what you're talking about. But regardless, run down those hunches.</p></li>
<li><p>You have correctly diagnosed your problem as an infinite loop, so focus your attention while debugging particularly on the loop condition.  Does it make sense?  (Hint: No.)  Again, read it out loud.  It helps.</p></li>
<li><p>You are writing a code version of a standard algorithm. Go back to your description of the algorithm, and verify that <strong>every step</strong> in the algorithm is found somewhere in your code. There's an operation in the original algorithm that is not in your program, and that's where the bug is.</p></li>
<li><p>Rename your variables so that their names more clearly represent their concepts. <code>error</code> is wrong; that's not the error. That's the <code>errorTolerance</code>.  <code>x</code> should be <code>approximation</code>. The error is computed by <code>currentError = approximation * approximation - a;</code> If you look at your program and ask yourself ""where is <code>errorTolerance</code> compared to <code>currentError</code>? you'd easily find your bug.  And if you do that, <strong>you'll write fewer silly bugs</strong>.</p></li>
<li><p>Generalize.  It is hard to see your error because you're not reading the code, you're reading its intended meaning.  You look at the code and what you see is:</p></li>
</ul>

<hr>

<pre><code>SOLVER
{
    VALIDATE ARGUMENT
    INITIALIZE APPROXIMATION
    while (true)
    {
      if (WITHIN TOLERANCES)
        RETURN APPROXIMATION
      REFINE APPROXIMATION
    }
}
</code></pre>

<hr>

<p>And <strong>that code is right</strong>.  You look at <code>if(Abs...</code> and see ""I'm checking to see if I'm within tolerances"", and that's the right place to do this step, and you don't even think ""but did I correctly implement it?""</p>

<p>But since that's the structure you expect your code to take, <strong>you could actually write it that way</strong>:</p>

<pre><code>class Solver
{
  private double a;
  private double approximation;

  private Solver(double a) {
    this.a = a;
  }

  public static double Solve(double a)
  {
    Solver s = new Solver(a);
    s.Validate();
    s.Initialize();
    while (true) {
      if (s.WithinTolerances())
        return s.approximation;
      s.Refine();
    }
  }

  private void Validate() { ... }
  private void Initialize() { ... }
  private bool WithinTolerances() { ... }
  private void Refine() { ... }
}
</code></pre>

<p>You are <strong>way less likely to make an error</strong> when you have a method that does <em>one thing</em> and does it <em>extremely well</em>, and bonus points if that method can be tested independently.</p>

<p>Notice that the class I just made above could be an abstract base class!  We could have a whole family of solvers that solved different problems using different techniques.</p>

<ul>
<li>Your code is sloppy in general.  <code>SqaureRoot</code> instead of <code>SquareRoot</code>.  <code>Exception</code> instead of <code>ArgumentException</code>.  And so on. Stop being sloppy. <strong>Get in the habit of making every single line of code you ever write a model of clarity and precision.</strong> It will make finding your inevitable mistakes much easier because you will not have to wade through a sea of smaller mistakes, some of which might be obscuring the larger mistake.</li>
</ul>

<p>Any of these techniques would find your bug quickly. <strong>Learn all of them today</strong>.</p>

My first attempt at resolving this mystery on Stack Overflow is <a href=""https://stackoverflow.com/questions/50274433/iterating-over-linked-list-in-c-is-slower-than-in-go"">here</a>. The example I coded up was problematic because:</p>

<p>1) memory access was unpredictable because of heap allocations, and </p>

<p>2) because there was no actual work being done, some people's compilers were optimizing away the main loop.</p>

<p>To resolve these issues I have a new program with implementations in C++ and Go. The C++ version takes 1.75 secs compared to 1.48 secs for the Go version. This time, I do one large heap allocation before timing begins and use it to operate an object pool from which I release and acquire nodes for the linked list. This way the memory access should be completely analogous between the two implementations.</p>

","<p>The big difference between your two programs is that your Go code ignores errors (and will panic or segfault, if you're lucky, if you empty the pool), while your C++ code propagates errors via exception. Compare:</p>

<pre><code>if p.size == 0 {
    fmt.Printf(""Attempting to pop from empty pool!\n"")
}
</code></pre>

<p>vs.</p>

<pre><code>if(_size == 0){throw std::out_of_range("""");}
</code></pre>

<hr>

<p>There are at least three ways<sup>1</sup> to make the comparison fair:</p>

<ol>
<li>Can change the C++ code to ignore the error, as you do in Go,</li>
<li>Change both versions to <code>panic</code>/<code>abort</code> on error.</li>
<li>Change the Go version to handle errors idiomatically,<sup>2</sup> as you do in C++.</li>
</ol>

<p>So, let's do all of them and compare the results<sup>3</sup>:</p>

<ul>
<li>C++ ignoring error:  1.059329s wall, 1.050000s user + 0.000000s system = 1.050000s CPU (99.1%)</li>
<li>C++ abort on error:  1.081585s wall, 1.060000s user + 0.000000s system = 1.060000s CPU (98.0%)</li>
<li>Go panic on error: Time elapsed: 1.152942427s</li>
<li>Go ignoring error: Time elapsed: 1.196426068s</li>
<li>Go idiomatic error handling: Time elapsed: 1.322005119s</li>
<li>C++ exception:  1.373458s wall, 1.360000s user + 0.000000s system = 1.360000s CPU (99.0%)</li>
</ul>

<hr>

<p>So:</p>

<ul>
<li>Without error handling, C++ is faster than Go.</li>
<li>With panicking, Go gets faster,<sup>4</sup> but still not as fast as C++.</li>
<li>With idiomatic error handling, C++ slows down a lot more than Go.</li>
</ul>

<p>Why? This exception never actually happens in your test run, so the actual error-handling code never runs in either language. But <code>clang</code> can't prove that it doesn't happen. And, since you never <code>catch</code> the exception anywhere, that means it has to emit exception handlers and stack unwinders for every non-elided frame all the way up the stack. So it's doing more work on each function call and return—not <em>much</em> more work, but then your function is doing so little real work that the unnecessary extra work adds up.</p>

<hr>

<p><sub>1. You could also change the C++ version to do C-style error handling, or to use an Option type, and probably other possibilities.</sub></p>

<p><sub>2. This, of course, requires a lot more changes: you need to import <code>errors</code>, change the return type of <code>Acquire</code> to <code>(*Node, error)</code>, change the return type of <code>processAge</code> to <code>error</code>, change all your <code>return</code> statements, and add at least two <code>if err != nil { … }</code> checks. But that's supposed to be a good thing about Go, right?</sub></p>

<p><sub>3. While I was at it, I replaced your legacy <code>boost::timer</code> with <code>boost::auto_cpu_timer</code>, so we're now seeing wall clock time (as with Go) as well as CPU time.</sub></p>

<p><sub>4. I won't attempt to explain why, because I don't understand it. From a quick glance at the assembly, it's clearly optimized out some checks, but I can't see why it couldn't optimize out those same checks without the <code>panic</code>.</sub></p>

<p>So according to this anything except above cannot be a statement. Then how does below line does not produce the above error.</p>

<pre><code>Anyclass obj;
</code></pre>

<p>Here we don't have any assignment or call or increment or decrement or new object expression.</p>

<p>I know I am missing something as the <a href=""https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/csharp/programming-guide/statements-expressions-operators/statements"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">official documentation</a> contradicts this error by saying declaration is also a statement.</p>
","<p>The error text is:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Only assignment, call, increment, decrement, and new object expressions can be used as a statement</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Your question includes the assertion:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>So according to this anything except above cannot be a statement.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>No, that is an incorrect conclusion.</p>

<p>First of all, what you're doing is simply a bad idea. <strong>Do not read the error messages to learn what the rules of the language are.</strong> The error messages are there to tell you what's wrong <em>with programs that are not legal</em>. They are not intended to be a guide as to what <em>is</em> legal!  Error messages are written assuming that the context is that you're looking at an illegal program at the same time as you are reading the error.  Error messages are a single sentence; the language specification is 800 pages long and has a lot more detail.  <strong>Read the specification</strong>.</p>

<p>Second: a correct conclusion is: according to that error message, no other <strong>expression</strong> can be used as a statement.  This error message is only produced in contexts where there is an invalid expression being used in a context where a statement is expected.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Then how does below line does not produce the above error.</p>

<pre><code>Anyclass obj;
</code></pre>
</blockquote>

<p>That line is not an expression, so the error message doesn't apply to it.</p>

<p>You made a wrong conclusion from this error message, which is evidence that this error message is confusing, and for that reason alone we could argue that it could be changed.  For example, we could say ""expression statement"" instead of ""statement"".  Or we could diagnose the larger problem, and report ""This statement consists of an expression that is typically only useful for its value, which is discarded. Only increment..."", and now the purpose of the message becomes more clear.</p>

<p>There are a great many error messages in C# that are confusing.  For example, consider my personal favorite:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>A params parameter must be the last parameter in a formal parameter list </p>
</blockquote>

<p>If you didn't know how params parameters worked, it would be reasonable to conclude from this error message that <code>(params int[] x, params int[] y)</code> is legal -- after all, a params parameter is the last parameter in a formal parameter list!  It would also be sensible to conclude that <code>(int x)</code> is wrong, because a params parameter is <em>not</em> the last parameter in that list!</p>

<p>Of course we know that what the error message means is ""<em>if</em> you have a params parameter then <em>that parameter</em> must be the last one in the formal parameter list"".</p>

<p>Error messages are one of the most important outputs of any compiler, and yet they are often confusing, ungrammatical, abstruse and unhelpful. Why is that?</p>

<ul>
<li>Compiler writers are not English majors. </li>
<li>Compiler error messages are often written with the compiler writer's convenience in mind, not with the user's convenience. Example: I spent literally weeks improving overload resolution error message reporting logic for problems involving lambdas so that adding LINQ to C# 3 did not make the error messages misleading. That was a <em>lot</em> of work, and it took away effort that could have been spent on other work.</li>
<li>Compiler writers are domain experts who can find it difficult to get back into ""beginner mind"". </li>
</ul>

<p>But hardest of all: </p>

<ul>
<li>to write an error message, a compiler writer must <em>imagine themselves to be in the mental state of someone who has made a mistake, and figure out what will remove the erroneous mental state</em> <strong>in a manner that leads to a correct program being written</strong>. That's a hard problem in human psychology!  Compiler writers are not mind readers, but they are asked to be all the time.</li>
</ul>

<p>So what's happening here is: the compiler is expecting a statement.  It found <code>expression ;</code> which looks like an <em>expression statement</em>. But only a subset of expressions are legal in an <em>expression statement</em>; if it is not one of those, then this error is reported.</p>

<hr>

<p>If you have an idea for how an error message can be improved, please don't report it here; start a discussion on the Roslyn github forum.</p>

<hr>

<p>Speaking of which: the error message you quote <em>is</em> wrong. It was never updated when <code>await</code> was added to the language. <code>await x</code> is an expression and <code>await x;</code> is legal. </p>

}
</code></pre>

<p>Type inference fails.  You ask why, and why questions are always difficult to answer, so let me rephrase the question:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>What line of the specification disallows this inference?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I have my copy of the C# 3 specification at hand; the line there is as follows </p>

<ul>
<li><code>V</code> is the type we are inferring <em>to</em>, so <code>I&lt;X&lt;T&gt;&gt;</code> in this case</li>
<li><code>U</code> is the type we are inferring <em>from</em>, so <code>C</code> in this case</li>
</ul>

<p>This will be slightly different in C# 4 because I added covariance, but we can ignore that for the purposes of this discussion.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>... if <code>V</code> is a constructed type <code>C&lt;V1, … Vk&gt;</code> and there is a unique set of types <code>U1, … Uk</code>  such that an implicit conversion exists from <code>U</code> to <code>C&lt;U1, … Uk&gt;</code> then an exact inference is made from each <code>Ui</code> to the corresponding <code>Vi</code>. Otherwise no inferences are made.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Notice the word <strong>unique</strong> in there.  There is NOT a unique set of types such that <code>C</code> is convertible to <code>I&lt;Something&gt;</code> because both <code>X&lt;Y&gt;</code> and <code>Z</code> are valid.</p>

<p>Here's another non-why question:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>What factors were considered when the design team made this decision?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>You are right that in theory we could detect in your case that <code>X&lt;Y&gt;</code> is intended and <code>Z</code> is not.  If you would care to propose a type inference algorithm that can handle non-unique situations like this that never makes a mistake -- remember, <code>Z</code> could be a subtype or a supertype of <code>X&lt;Y&gt;</code> or <code>X&lt;Something Else&gt;</code> and <code>I</code> could be covariant -- then I am sure that the C# team would be happy to consider your proposal.  </p>

<p>We had that argument in 2005 when designing the C# 3 type inference algorithm and decided that scenarios where one class implements two of the same interface were rare, and that dealing with those rare situations created considerable complications in the language.  Those complications would be expensive to design, specify, implement and test, and we had other things to spend money and effort on that would have bigger impact. </p>

<p>Also, we did not know when we made C# 3 whether or not we would be adding covariance in C# 4. <strong>We never want to introduce a new language feature that makes a possible future language feature impossible or difficult</strong>.  It is better to put restrictions in the language now and consider removing them later than to do a lot of work for a rare scenario that makes a common scenario difficult in the next version.</p>

<p>The fact that I helped design this algorithm and implemented it multiple times, and completely did not remember this rule at first should tell you how often this has come up in the last 13 years.  Hardly at all.  It is very rare for someone to be in your particular boat, and there is an easy workaround: specify the type.</p>

<p>A question which you did not ask but comes to mind:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Could the error message be better?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Yep.  I apologize for that. I did a lot of work making overload resolution error messages more descriptive for common LINQ scenarios, and I always wanted to go back and make the other type inference error messages more clear.  I wrote the type inference and overload resolution code to maintain internal information explaining why a type had been inferred or an overload had been chosen or rejected, both for my own debugging purposes and to make better error messages, but I never got around to exposing that information to the user.  There was always something higher priority. </p>

<p>You might consider entering an issue at the Roslyn GitHub site suggesting that this error message be improved to help users diagnose the situation more easily. Again, the fact that I didn't immediately diagnose the problem and had to go back to the spec is indicative that the message is unclear.</p>

<p>(Inspired by <a href=""https://irclog.perlgeek.de/perl6/2018-05-20#i_16185508"" rel=""noreferrer"">this question by PMurias in the #perl6 IRC channel</a>)</p>
","<p><a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Modulo_operation"" rel=""noreferrer"">Wikipedia has a great article on this</a>, including history as well as theory.</p>

<hr>

<p>As long as a language satisfies the Euclidean division property that <code>(a/b) * b + (a%b) == a</code>, both flooring division and truncating division are coherent and arithmetically sensible.</p>

<hr>

<p>Of course people like to argue that one is obviously correct and the other is obviously wrong, but it has more the character of a holy war than a sensible discussion, and it usually has more to do with the choice of their early preferred language than anything else. They also often tend to argue primarily for their chosen <code>%</code>, even though it probably makes more sense to choose <code>/</code> first and then just pick the <code>%</code> that matches.</p>

<ul>
<li>Flooring (like Python):

<ul>
<li>No less an authority than Donald Knuth suggests it.</li>
<li><code>%</code> following the sign of the divisor is apparently what about 70% of all students guess</li>
<li>The operator is usually read as <code>mod</code> or <code>modulo</code> rather than <code>remainder</code>.</li>
<li>""C does it""—which isn't even true.<sup>1</sup></li>
</ul></li>
<li>Truncating (like C++):

<ul>
<li>Makes integer division more consistent with IEEE float division (in default rounding mode).</li>
<li>More CPUs implement it. (May not be true at different times in history.)</li>
<li>The operator is read <code>modulo</code> rather than <code>remainder</code> (even though this actually argues <em>against</em> their point).</li>
<li>The division property conceptually is more about remainder than modulus.</li>
<li>The operator is read <code>mod</code> rather than <code>modulo</code>, so it should follow Fortran's distinction. (This may sound silly, but may have been the clincher for C99. See <a href=""https://groups.google.com/forum/#!msg/comp.std.c/hjGK3cx_I-o/_zB17QyViDgJ"" rel=""noreferrer"">this thread</a>.)</li>
</ul></li>
<li>""Euclidean"" (like Pascal—<code>/</code> floors or truncates depending on signs, so <code>%</code> is never negative):

<ul>
<li>Niklaus Wirth argued that nobody is ever surprised by positive <code>mod</code>.</li>
<li>Raymond T. Boute later argued that you can't implement Euclidean division naively with either of the other rules.</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>

<p>A number of languages provide both. Typically—as in Ada, Modula-2, some Lisps, Haskell, and Julia—they use names related to <code>mod</code> for the Python-style operator and <code>rem</code> for the C++-style operator. But not always—Fortran, for example, calls the same things <code>modulo</code> and <code>mod</code> (as mentioned above for C99).</p>

<hr>

<p>We don't know why Python, Tcl, Perl, and the other influential scripting languages mostly chose flooring. As noted in the question, Guido van Rossum's answer only explains why he had to choose one of the three consistent answers, not why he picked the one he did.</p>

<p>However, I suspect the influence of C was key. Most scripting languages are (at least initially) implemented in C, and borrow their operator inventory from C. C89's implementation-defined <code>%</code> is obviously broken, and not suitable for a ""friendly"" language like Tcl or Python. And C calls the operator ""mod"". So they go with modulus, not remainder.</p>

<hr>

<p><sub>1. Despite what the question says—and many people using it as an argument—C actually <em>doesn't</em> have similar behavior to Python and friends. C99 requires truncating division, not flooring. C89 allowed either, and also allowed either version of mod, so there's no guarantee of the division property, and no way to write portable code doing signed integer division. That's just broken.</sub></p>

<li>Reflection enables us to write code that <em>analyzes other code</em>.</li>
</ul>

<p>Consider for example the most basic question about an assembly: what types are in it?  Assemblies are <em>self-describing</em> and reflection is the mechanism by which that description is surfaced to other code.</p>

<p>Suppose for example you wanted to write a program which took an assembly and did a graphical display of the relationships between the various classes in that assembly, to help you understand that code.  There are such tools. They're in Visual Studio.  <strong>Someone wrote those tools.</strong> They did not appear by magic.  Reflection is the mechanism designed into the .NET framework that enables you or me or anyone else to write tools that understand code.</p>

<ul>
<li>Reflection enables us to move compile time bindings to runtime.</li>
</ul>

<p>Suppose you have a static method <code>Foo.Bar()</code>.  When you put a call to <code>Foo.Bar()</code> in your program, you know with 100% certainty that the method you think is going to be called is actually going to be called.  We call static methods ""static"" because the binding from the name Bar to the code that gets called can be understood <em>statically</em> -- that is, without running the program.</p>

<p>Now consider a virtual method <code>Blah()</code> on a base class.  When you call <code>whatever.Blah()</code> you don't know exactly which <code>Blah()</code> will be called at compile time, but you know that <em>some</em> method <code>Blah()</code> with no arguments will be called on <em>some</em> type that is the runtime type of <code>whatever</code>, and that type is equal to or derived from the type which declares <code>Blah()</code>.  (In fact you know more: you know that it is equal to or derived from the compile time type of <code>whatever</code>.)  Virtual binding is a form of dynamic binding, but it is not <em>fully</em> dynamic. There's no way for the user to decide that this call should be to a different method on a different type hierarchy.</p>

<p>Reflection enables us to make calls that are bound <em>entirely</em> at runtime, based <em>entirely</em> on user choices if we like. We pay a performance penalty, and we lose compile-time type safety, but we gain the flexibility to decide 100% at runtime what code we call. There are scenarios where that's a reasonable tradeoff.</p>

<p>The fields are:</p>

<p>The constraint must allow <strong>n</strong> records while the <strong>Deleted</strong> field is <strong>1</strong>, but if the <strong>Deleted</strong> field is <strong>0</strong> there must be only one row with the same Date and Passport.</p>

<p>Should work for this steps:</p>

<ol>
<li>Adding a row with Id=1, Date=2018-05-01, Passport=MPEUIE80, Deleted=0</li>
<li>Deleting the row with Id=1, so the field Deleted will be 1</li>
<li>Adding a row with Id=2, Date=2018-05-01, Passport=MPEUIE80, Deleted=0</li>

","<p>You can use a filtered, unique index:</p>

<pre><code>create table [t](
    [id] [int] NULL,
    [date] [datetime] NULL,
    [passport] [char](8) NULL,
    [deleted] [int] NULL
)

create unique index unq_t_date_passport on t(date, passport)
    where deleted = 0;
</code></pre>

<p>EDIT:</p>

<p>If filtered indexes are not working on your version of SQL Server, then you might want to check the <a href=""https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/sql/t-sql/statements/alter-database-transact-sql-compatibility-level?view=sql-server-2017"" rel=""noreferrer"">compatibility level</a>.  It should be available whenever the compatibility is set to 100 or higher.  You can check your server version and compatibility level using:</p>

<pre><code>SELECT SERVERPROPERTY('ProductVersion');
SELECT name, compatibility_level FROM sys.databases;
</code></pre>

<p>There is another method that will work starting in SQL Server 2005, assuming the id is unique and non-negative.  It uses a computed column to do essentially the same thing as the filtered index:</p>

<pre><code>alter table t
    add column deleted_id (case when deleted = 0 then -1 else id end) persisted;

create unique index unq_t_passport_date_deleted_id on t(passport, date, deleted_id);

      throw new ArgumentNullException(nameof(argument));

   return argument;
}
</code></pre>

<p>This basically check if the object that's being passed isn't null. What I am trying to do is create another extension method where the <code>int</code> value which is being passed in isn't 0. So I have gone ahead and created:</p>

<pre><code>public static T ThrowIfZero&lt;T&gt;(this T argument) where T : struct
{
   if (argument == 0)
     throw new ArgumentOutOfRangeException(""some error here"");

<p>Of course the above does not compile suggesting the error:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Error CS0019  Operator '==' cannot be applied to operands of type 'T' and 'int'</p>

<p>Can someone point me to the right direction on how I would check if the argument value isn't <code>0</code>?</p>
","<p>You could simply use <code>Equals</code>:</p>

<pre><code>public static T ThrowIfZero&lt;T&gt;(this T argument) where T : struct
{
    if (argument.Equals(0))
        throw new ArgumentOutOfRangeException(""some error here"");

    return argument;
}

<p>But that will not really work well if the argument is for example a decimal <code>0.0m</code> which is not equal to the integer <code>0</code> as Peter has commented correctly.</p>

<p>So if you want a version that works for any number you could use this approach:</p>

<pre><code>public static T ThrowIfZero&lt;T&gt;(this T argument) where T : struct
{
    bool isZero = Decimal.Compare(0.0m, Convert.ToDecimal(argument)) == 0;
    if (isZero)

<ul>
<li>they take ~15 lines</li>
<li>only the main function is called from somewhere else</li>
<li>no plans on reusing the helper functions in the near future</li>
</ul>

<p>Simplified example:</p>

<pre><code>def create_filled_template_in_temp(path, values_mapping):
    template_text = path.read_text()
    filled_template = _fill_template(template_text, values_mapping)
    result_path = _save_in_temp(filled_template)
    return result_path

def _fill_template(template_text, values_mapping):
    ...

def _save_in_temp(filled_template):
    _, pathname = tempfile.mkstemp(suffix='.ini', text=True)
    path = pathlib.Path(pathname)
    path.write_text(text)
    return path

...
create_filled_template_in_temp(path, values_mapping)
</code></pre>

<p>Please note that I don't want the helper methods on the module level because they belong to only one method. Imagine having several such examples as above in the same module. Maany non-public functions on module level. A mess (and this happens many times). Also I'd like to give them context and use the context's name to simplify the naming inside.</p>

<p><strong>Solution #0: A module</strong></p>

<p>Just put it in another module:</p>

<pre><code>template_fillers.create_in_temp(path, values_mapping)
</code></pre>

<p>Problems:</p>

<ul>
<li>that's too little code to add a file, especially when there are many files already (this creates a mess)</li>
<li>this is an action and now I'm forced to create a noun-based name for the module (or break the modules naming rule). Moreover making it simple will make it too broad (in this case creating a set that really is a singleton).</li>
</ul>

<p>Finally this is just too little code to add a module for it.</p>

<p><strong>Solution #1: A class</strong></p>

<p>Create a class with no <code>__init__</code> and only one public (by naming convention) method:</p>

<pre><code>class TemplateFillerIntoTemp:
    def run(self, path, values_mapping):
        template_text = path.read_text()
        filled_template = self._fill_template(template_text, values_mapping)
        result_path = self._save_in_temp(filled_template)
        return result_path

    def _fill_template(self, template_text, values_mapping):
        ...

    def _save_in_temp(self, filled_template):
        _, pathname = tempfile.mkstemp(suffix='.ini', text=True)
        path = pathlib.Path(pathname)
        path.write_text(text)
        return path

 ...
 TemplateFillerIntoTemp().run(path, values_mapping)
</code></pre>

<p>This is what I did many times in the past. Problems:</p>

<ul>
<li>there are no side effects, so there's no need to have the class' instance</li>
<li>this is an action and now I'm forced to create a noun-based name for the class (or break the classes naming rule). This leads to many of those ""managers"" or ""creators"".</li>
<li>this is a misuse of a class concept, this is just a little execution tree with a single function-interface, not a class of things. Misusing concepts slows down understanding and may lead to further blending between uses. I know that in OOP this is common because in some languages you can't really make a function outside of a class, but this is too radical approach to order in code. Objects are useful when they are the closest expression of your idea. This isn't the case. Forcing not fitting order paradoxically generates disorder of a different kind :)</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Solution #2: Static class</strong></p>

<p>Take solution #1, add <code>@staticmethod</code> everywhere. Possibly also ABC metaclass.</p>

<pre><code> TemplateFillerIntoTemp.run(path, values_mapping)
</code></pre>

<p>Pro: there is a clear indication that this all is instance-independent. Con: there's more code.</p>

<p><strong>Solution #3: Class with a __call__</strong></p>

<p>Take solution #1, create a <code>__call__</code> function with the main method, then create on module level a single instance called <code>create_filled_template_in_temp</code>.</p>

<pre><code>create_filled_template_in_temp(path, values_mapping)
</code></pre>

<p>Pro: calls like a single function. Con: implementation is overblown, not really fit for the purpose.</p>

<p><strong>Solution #4: Insert helper functions into main function</strong></p>

<p>Add them inside.</p>

<pre><code>def create_filled_template_in_temp(path, values_mapping):
    def _fill_template(template_text, values_mapping):
        ...

    def _save_in_temp(filled_template):
        _, pathname = tempfile.mkstemp(suffix='.ini', text=True)
        path = pathlib.Path(pathname)
        path.write_text(text)
        return path

    template_text = path.read_text()
    filled_template = _fill_template(template_text, values_mapping)
    result_path = _save_in_temp(filled_template)
    return result_path

...
create_filled_template_in_temp(path, values_mapping)
</code></pre>

<p>Pro: this looks well if total number of lines is small and there are very few helper functions. Con: it doesn't otherwise.</p>
","<p>Modification of #4: Make inner functions, and also have the function's body be an inner function. This has the nice property of still reading top-to-bottom, rather than having the body all the way at the bottom.</p>

    def body():

<li>A method implemented by a value type <code>S</code> is implemented as though it has an invisible <code>ref S</code> argument; that is how <code>this</code> is passed.</li>
<li>A method implemented by a reference type <code>C</code> is implemented as if there was an invisible <code>C</code> argument; that is how <code>this</code> is passed.</li>
<li>The interesting case is then a virtual method defined in a reference base class and overridden by a struct that inherits from the base class.</li>
</ul>

<p>Now you have enough information to deduce what happens. <code>GetHashCode</code> is virtual <strong>and overridden by <code>Nullable&lt;T&gt;</code></strong> so when you call it, you call it as though there was an invisible <code>ref Nullable&lt;T&gt;</code> argument for <code>this</code>.  No boxing happens.</p>

<p><code>GetType</code> is not virtual and so cannot be overridden and is defined on <code>object</code>. Therefore it expects an <code>object</code> for <code>this</code>,  When called on a <code>Nullable&lt;T&gt;</code> the receiver must be boxed, and therefore can box to null, and therefore can throw.</p>

<p>If you called <code>((object)x).GetHashCode()</code> then you'd see an exception.</p>

<p>My list looks like this </p>

<pre><code>1, 2
2, 3
3, 1
3, 2
2, 4
4, 3
</code></pre>

<p>... i dont need (2, 3) and (3, 2)</p>

<p>I made a <code>public struct FaceLine</code> with <code>public int A</code> and <code>B</code>, then <code>var faceline = new List&lt;FaceLine&gt;();</code>.</p>

<p>Im kind of new in c# and lost.
thanks for any help</p>
","<p>You could use a custom <code>IEqualityComparer&lt;FaceLine&gt;</code>:</p>

<pre><code>public class UnorderedFacelineComparer : IEqualityComparer&lt;FaceLine&gt;
{
    public bool Equals(FaceLine x, FaceLine y)
    {
        int x1 = Math.Min(x.A, x.B);
        int x2 = Math.Max(x.A, x.B);
        int y1 = Math.Min(y.A, y.B);
        int y2 = Math.Max(y.A, y.B);
        return x1 == y1 &amp;&amp; x2 == y2;
    }

    public int GetHashCode(FaceLine obj)
    {
        return obj.A ^ obj.B;
    }
}
</code></pre>

<p>Then the query was very simple:</p>

<pre><code>var comparer = new UnorderedFacelineComparer();
List&lt;FaceLine&gt; nonDupList = faceLine
    .GroupBy(fl =&gt; fl, comparer)
    .Where(g =&gt; g.Count() == 1)
    .Select(g =&gt; g.First())
    .ToList();
</code></pre>

<p>If you wanted to keep one of the duplicates you just need to remove the <code>Where</code>:</p>

<pre><code>List&lt;FaceLine&gt; nonDupList = faceLine
    .GroupBy(fl =&gt; fl, comparer)
    .Select(g =&gt; g.First())
    .ToList();
</code></pre>

","<p>When passed a <code>bytes</code> object, <code>float()</code> treats the contents of the object as ASCII bytes.

<ul>
<li>because the input is not a string, <a href=""https://docs.python.org/3/c-api/number.html#c.PyNumber_Float"" rel=""noreferrer""><code>PyNumber_Float()</code></a> is called on the object (for <code>str</code> objects the code jumps straight to <code>PyFloat_FromString</code>).</li>

<p>According to F# manuals, there are two operations to construct lists, they are cons (aka <code>::</code>) and <code>@</code>. Given the fact <code>@</code> is more versatile (can merge sublists, not single elements, and can append to the tail as well, unlike the cons operation), my question is: at which situation we <strong>must</strong> use exactly <code>::</code> instead of <code>@</code> to avoid ambiguity, or non-wanted side-effects and so on? </p>

<p>In other words: is <code>::</code> theoretically redundant or not?</p>
","<p>The <code>list</code> type has two constructors: <code>[]</code> and <code>::</code>. If <code>::</code> were removed, only the <code>[]</code> constructor would be left, making it impossible to create non-empty lists.</p>

<p>Note that something like <code>[1;2;3]</code> is syntactic sugar for <code>1::2::3::[]</code>, so it relies on the existence of <code>::</code>.</p>

<p>Similarly, <code>@</code> is a function that's defined using <code>::</code>, so if <code>::</code> didn't exist, neither could <code>@</code>.</p>

<p>Note that <code>@</code> isn't suitable as a replacement for <code>::</code> in <code>list</code>'s definition as, if you don't already have a way to construct non-empty lists, <code>@</code> can't be used to create them (<code>[] @ []</code> is still an empty list).</p>

<p>And even if you added a constructor for single-item lists, <code>@</code> would lead to an ambiguous representation because <code>[1;2;3]</code> could be represented either as <code>([1] @ [2]) @ [3]</code> or as <code>[1]  @ ([2] @ [3])</code> (plus, you could just add <code>@ []</code> anywhere you want). So you'd end up with several different representations for semantically equivalent lists.</p>

</code></pre>
","<p>I'm <em>deliberately</em> not going to write the code for you, but instead giving you pointers as to how you can solve the problem on your own.</p>

<p>Currently, your function uses multiple <code>print()</code> function calls to write lines to the console. Your teacher wants you to return those lines, as a single value, to the caller of the function.</p>

<p>There are two problems you must overcome:</p>

<ol>
<li>you must collect all those lines you are now printing into a single string to return.</li>
<li>you must add the newlines that <code>print()</code> would add, manually.</li>
</ol>

<p>The easiest way to do this is to use a list, to which you append each string you are printing.</p>

<ul>
<li>Put a new variable at the top of your function, assign an empty list. A name like <code>lines</code> would probably be a good idea.</li>
<li>Append each line you are now printing, to that list. The list type has a method to append a value to it, you can trivially replace all the <code>print()</code> calls with that method.</li>
<li>At the end of the function, use a single string method to <em>concatenate</em> all the values in the list into one long string. You specify a string to put between the values, if you use the <code>'\n'</code> string then Python will use a newline character (<code>\...</code> is an escape sequence, <code>\n</code> produces a <em>newline</em> character)</li>
<li>return the resulting single string.</li>
</ul>

<p>You can find the methods needed for this in the <a href=""https://docs.python.org/3/library/stdtypes.html"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer""><em>Built-in Types</em> documentation</a>.</p>

<p>You could also use a string variable at the top, then concatenating each string you now print, to that variable, adding a newline each time. But experienced programmers use a list instead, because that's <em>cheaper</em> for a computer program to process. Concatenating a string to another string requires the computer to create a whole new copy for the result, so it has to read all the characters of the old string, all the characters of the concatenated string, and then create a copy of all those characters to put into a new string. You then do the same for the next string you concatenate, but now the result is longer still. You end up making a lot of copies of those initial characters.</p>

<p>Appending a value to a list doesn't have to make a copy, on the other hand, and you then only have to create a copy of all the characters in all the strings in the list <em>once</em> to create the output. In terms of <a href=""https://devopedia.org/algorithmic-complexity"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer""><em>algorithmic complexity</em></a>, repeatedly concatenating a string takes O(n**2) time (for <em>n</em> strings, concatenating takes <em>quadradic</em> time, add one more string and the time doubles), while appending those same strings to a list only takes O(n) time (for <em>n</em> strings, adding one more takes <em>linear</em> time, add one more string and the time grows proportionally).</p>

<p>For a half a dozen strings, the difference is not going to be noticeable, but when your program has to process thousands of lines, things can get out of hand quickly. Concatenating a thousand strings in a loop can take a thousand times more time than adding those same strings to a list first, then joining them together afterwards. It quickly becomes obvious why programmers have to care about these little details.</p>

Is their any real reason to do this or it's simply purely cosmetic ?</p>
","<p>For pointers, object references, dynamic arrays, interfaces, there is no difference. You can do either.</p>

<p>For method pointers there is a difference. The IDE form designer does some trickery with published method pointer properties, e.g. events. When these are <code>nil</code> the IDE form designer stores an index in the low two bytes of one of the pointers. If you were to test this against <code>nil</code> you would find that the value was not <code>nil</code>, which is not desired.</p>

<p>So you use <code>Assigned</code> which ignores the low two bytes. This is possible on Windows because memory addresses lower than 65536 are reserved and cannot be valid pointers. This is critical for code that runs in the IDE form designer, i.e. design time packages. Component writers must use <code>Assigned</code> in these situations.</p>

<p>Note that this only applies to the Win32 compiler. Since that is the only platform on which the IDE runs, that is the only platform where <code>Assigned</code> has this special behaviour.</p>

<p>Allen Bauer discusses this here: <a href=""https://community.embarcadero.com/blogs/entry/assigned-or-not-assigned-that-is-the-question-28836"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Assigned or not Assigned, that is the question...</a></p>

<p>One further point to make:</p>

<ul>
<li>It is never wrong to use <code>Assigned</code>.</li>
<li>It is wrong to compare against <code>nil</code> when the subject is a method pointer that backs a published property, and your code runs at design time.</li>
</ul>

<p>Personally, I always use <code>Assigned</code> because that gives consistency to the code. Further it means that you don't even have to consider whether or not the subject of the test is a single pointer type or a double pointer type, or whether your code ever runs in the designer.</p>

<p>And while I understand its type signature and what it does, I can't for the life of me understand why it does it. So could someone please write out the de-pointfreed version of it for me, and maybe step by step work back to the pointfree version sorta like this:</p>

</code></pre>

<p>Now if we apply the argument to the function, we get:</p>

<p>Now <code>b</code> is just an argument to <code>f</code>, so we can rewrite this as:</p>

<pre><code>f b = (\c d -&gt; c . d) . b

<p>The definition of <code>.</code> is <code>f . g = \x -&gt; f (g x)</code>. If replace the outer <code>.</code> with its definition, we get:</p>

<p>Again we can turn <code>x</code> into a regular parameter:</p>

</code></pre>

<p>I would expect that the classes <em>big</em> and <em>small</em> should be of the same size; however strangely, <em>big</em> takes up more memory than <em>small</em> even though they both, seemingly, contain the same data.</p>

<p>Also even if the size of the array in the union is changed, the difference between the size of <em>big</em> and <em>small</em> is a constant 4 bytes.</p>

<p>-Edit:</p>

<p>It seems as though this behavior is not specific to classes with union data types. Similar behavior occurs in other similar situations where a derived class has a member with the base class type. Thanks to those who pointed this out.</p>
","<p>This is because of what I call the ""unique identity rule"" of C++. Every (live) object in C++ of a particular type <code>T</code> <em>must always</em> have a different address from every other live object of type <code>T</code>. The compiler cannot provide a layout for a type where this rule would be violated, where two distinct subobjects with the same type <code>T</code> would have the same offset in the layout of their containing object.</p>

<p>Class <code>big</code> contains two subobjects of note: a base class <code>empty_class</code> and an anonymous union containing a member <code>empty_class</code>. </p>

<p>The empty base optimization is based on aliasing the ""storage"" for an empty base class with other types. Typically, this is done by giving it the same address as the parent class, which means the address will typically be the same as the first non-empty base or first member subobject.</p>

<p>If the compiler gave the base class <code>empty_class</code> the same address as the union member, then you would have two distinct subobjects of the class (<code>big::empty_class</code> and <code>big::a</code>) which have the same address but are different objects.</p>

<p>Such a layout would violate the unique identity rule. And therefore, the compiler <em>cannot</em> employ the empty base optimization here. That's also why <code>big</code> is not standard layout.</p>

When you define a variable as <code>volatile</code>, you tell the compiler to avoid optimizing that variable. Can we use the two approaches interchangeably? And if so what are the pros and cons? Below are some pros and cons that I can think of. Are there any more?</p>

<p><strong>Pros:</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>Using the <strong>-O0</strong> flag is helpful if we have a big code base inside which the variables that should have been declared as <code>volatile</code>, are not. If the code is showing buggy behavior, instead of going in the code and finding which variables need to be declared as volatile, we can just use the <strong>-O0</strong> flag to eliminate the possibility that optimization is causing the problem.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Cons:</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>The <strong>-O0</strong> flag will affect the entire code while the <code>volatile</code> keyword only affects a specific variable. If we're working on a small microcontroller for example, this could be a problem since using <strong>-O0</strong> may produce a big executable.</li>
</ul>
","<p>Compiler flag <code>-O0</code> is in no way a replacement for proper use of <code>volatile</code>, because the code that does not work when it is properly optimized by the compiler is inherently broken. You do not want a broken code giving you an appearance of ""working"" until someone forgets to throw the <code>-O0</code> switch.</p>

<p>It is unusual even for large code bases to have a need for many volatile variables, in terms of the total percentage of variables in the code. Fixing a large code base with missing <code>volatile</code> is likely to require finding a few strategic places where multiple variables need to be <code>volatile</code>, and fixing just these few, rather than taking a ""shotgun approach"" and disabling all optimizations.</p>

I was wondering why we need to explicitly declare <code>auto</code> if the compiler is able to automatically deduce the type. I know C++ is a strongly typed language and this is a rule but was it not possible to achieve the same outcome without explicitly declaring a variable <code>auto</code>?</p>
","<blockquote>
  <p>was it not possible to achieve the same outcome without explicitly declaring a variable <code>auto</code>?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I am going to rephrase your question slightly in a way that will help you understand why you need <code>auto</code>:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Was it not possible to achieve the same outcome without explicitly <em>using a type placeholder</em>?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Was it not <em>possible</em>? Of course it was ""possible"". The question is whether it would be worth the effort to do it.</p>

<p>Most syntaxes in other languages that do not typenames work in one of two ways. There's the Go-like way, where <code>name := value;</code> declares a variable. And there's the Python-like way, where <code>name = value;</code> declares a new variable if <code>name</code> has not previously been declared.</p>

<p>Let's assume that there are no syntactic issues with applying either syntax to C++ (even though I can already see that <code>identifier</code> followed by <code>:</code> in C++ means ""make a label""). So, what do you lose compared to placeholders?</p>

<p>Well, I can no longer do this:</p>

<pre><code>auto &amp;name = get&lt;0&gt;(some_tuple);
</code></pre>

<p>See, <code>auto</code> always means ""value"". If you want to get a reference, you need to explicitly use a <code>&amp;</code>. And it will rightly fail to compile if the assignment expression is a prvalue. Neither of the assignment-based syntaxes has a way to differentiate between references and values.</p>

<p>Now, you could make such assignment syntaxes deduce references if the given value is a reference. But that would mean that you can't do:</p>

<pre><code>auto name = get&lt;0&gt;(some_tuple);
</code></pre>

<p>This <em>copies</em> from the tuple, creating an object independent of <code>some_tuple</code>. Sometimes, that's exactly what you want. This is even more useful if you want to move from the tuple with <code>auto name = get&lt;0&gt;(std::move(some_tuple));</code>.</p>

<p>OK, so maybe we could extend these syntaxes a bit to account for this distinction. Maybe <code>&amp;name := value;</code> or <code>&amp;name = value;</code> would mean to deduce a reference like <code>auto&amp;</code>.</p>

<p>OK, fine. What about this:</p>

<pre><code>decltype(auto) name = some_thing();
</code></pre>

<p>Oh that's right; C++ actually has <a href=""http://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/language/auto"" rel=""noreferrer""><em>two</em> placeholders: <code>auto</code> and <code>decltype(auto)</code></a>. The basic idea of this deduction is that it works exactly as if you had done <code>decltype(expr) name = expr;</code>. So in our case, if <code>some_thing()</code> is an object, it will deduce an object. If <code>some_thing()</code> is a reference, it will deduce a reference.</p>

<p>This is very useful when you're working in template code and are not sure exactly what the return value of a function will be. This is great for forwarding, and it is an essential tool, even if it is not widely used.</p>

<p>So now we need to add more to our syntax. <code>name ::= value;</code> means ""do what <code>decltype(auto)</code> does"". I don't have an equivalent for the Pythonic variant.</p>

<p>Looking at this syntax, isn't that rather easy to accidentally mis-type? Not only that, it's hardly self-documenting. Even if you've never seen <code>decltype(auto)</code> before, it's big and obvious enough that you can at least easily tell that there's something special going on. Whereas the visual difference between <code>::=</code> and <code>:=</code> is minimal.</p>

<p>But that's opinion stuff; there are more substantive issues. See, all of this is based on using assignment syntax. Well... what about places where you <em>can't</em> use assignment syntax? Like this:</p>

<pre><code>for(auto &amp;x : container)
</code></pre>

<p>Do we change that to <code>for(&amp;x := container)</code>? Because that seems to be saying something <em>very different</em> from range-based <code>for</code>. It looks like it's the initializer statement from a regular <code>for</code> loop, not a range-based <code>for</code>. It would also be a different syntax from non-deduced cases.</p>

<p>Also, copy-initialization (using <code>=</code>) is not the same thing in C++ as direct-initialization (using constructor syntax). So <code>name := value;</code> may not work in cases where <code>auto name(value)</code> would have.</p>

<p>Sure, you could declare that <code>:=</code> will use direct-initialization, but that would be quite in-congruent with the way the rest of C++ behaves.</p>

<p>Also, there's one more thing: C++14. It gave us one useful deduction feature: return type deduction. But this is based on placeholders. So much like range-based <code>for</code>, it is fundamentally based on a typename that gets filled in by the compiler, not by some syntax applied to a particular name and expression.</p>

<p>See, all of these problems come from the same source: you're inventing entirely new syntax for declaring variables. Placeholder-based declarations didn't have to invent new <em>syntax</em>. They're using the exact same syntax as before; they're just employing a new keyword that acts like a type, but has a special meaning. This is what allows it to work in range-based <code>for</code> and for return type deduction. It is what allows it to have multiple forms (<code>auto</code> vs. <code>decltype(auto)</code>). And so forth.</p>

<p>Placeholders work because they are the simplest solution to the problem, while simultaneously retaining all of the benefits and generality of using an actual type name. If you came up with another alternative that worked as universally as placeholders do, it is highly unlikely that it would be as simple as placeholders.</p>

<p>Unless it was just spelling placeholders with different keywords or symbols...</p>

<h3>Contrived Example</h3>

<p><em>ExampleSuperClass.java</em>:</p>

<pre class=""lang-java prettyprint-override""><code>package foo;

public class ExampleSuperClass&lt;T&gt; {
    protected T field;

    public ExampleSuperClass(T field) {
        this.field = field;
    }

    public T getField() {
        return field;
    }
}

<p><em>ExampleSubClass.java</em>:</p>

<pre class=""lang-java prettyprint-override""><code>package foo;

public class ExampleSubClass extends ExampleSuperClass&lt;Member&gt; {

    static class Member {

    }

    public ExampleSubClass() {
        super(new Member());
    }
}
</code></pre>

<p>Compilation fails on <code>ExampleSubClass.java</code> with error:</p>

<blockquote>
<pre><code>[javac] ExampleSubClass.java:3: error: cannot find symbol
[javac] public class ExampleSubClass extends ExampleSuperClass&lt;Member&gt; {
[javac]                                                        ^
[javac]   symbol: class Member
[javac] 1 error
</code></pre>
</blockquote>

<p>or in Eclipse with:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Member cannot be resolved to a type</p>
</blockquote>

<p>in Eclipse the <code>super</code> invocation also has the error:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>The constructor ExampleSuperClass(Member) refers to missing type Member</p>
</blockquote>

<p><br/></p>

<p>It works fine (aka no errors) if ExampleSubClass is instead parameterized with another package-protected top-level class.</p>

<p><br/></p>

<h3>Summary</h3>

<p>The driving force behind this is that I have a generic super class and many different <code>${SubClass-extends-GenericSuperClass}.java</code> and <code>${ClassUsedBySubClass}.java</code> pairs. But since <code>ClassUsedBySubClass</code> is only ever referenced by <code>SubClass</code>, it would be nice to:</p>

<ol>
<li>restrict <code>ClassUsedBySubClass</code>'s access by making it a static member class and  </li>
<li>cut down on the number of files by not giving <code>ClassUsedBySubClass</code> its own file.</li>
</ol>

<p>So, is there a way to use a subclass's member class in parameterizing the superclass?</p>

<p>If there isn't -- is there an alternative approach?</p>
","<p>Yes, you can do it. However, since Java uses the scope <em>outside</em> the declaration for name resolution, you must qualify <code>Member</code> with the name of <code>ExampleSubClass</code>:</p>

<pre><code>public class ExampleSubClass extends ExampleSuperClass&lt;ExampleSubClass.Member&gt; {

<pre><code>struct foo {
   int a;
};
</code></pre>

<p><strong>bar.c</strong></p>

<pre><code>struct foo {

}
</code></pre>

<p><strong>bar.c</strong></p>

<pre><code>int foo() {
    return 0;
}
</code></pre>

<p>and will result in linking error (multiple definition of function <code>foo</code>).</p>

<p>Why is that? What's the difference between struct names and function names that makes C unable to handle one but not the other?
Also does this behavior extend to C++?</p>
","<p>The distinguishing concept in this case is called <em>linkage</em>. </p>

<p>In C struct, union or enum tags have <em>no linkage</em>. They are effectively local to their scope. </p>

<blockquote>
  <p><strong>6.2.2 Linkages of identifiers</strong><br>
  <strong>6</strong> The following identifiers have no linkage: an identifier declared to be anything other than
  an object or a function; an identifier declared to be a function parameter; a block scope
  identifier for an object declared without the storage-class specifier <code>extern</code>.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>They cannot be re-declared in the same scope (except for so called <em>forward declarations</em>). But they can be freely re-declared in different scopes, including different translation units. In different scopes they may declare completely independent types. This is what you have in your example: in two different translation units (i.e. in two different file scopes) you declared two different and unrelated <code>struct foo</code> types. This is perfectly legal.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, functions have linkage in C. In your example these two definitions define the same function <code>foo</code> with <em>external</em> linkage. And you are not allowed to provide more than one definition of any external linkage function in your entire program</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><strong>6.9 External definitions</strong><br>
  <strong>5</strong> [...] If an identifier declared with external
  linkage is used in an expression (other than as part of the operand of a <code>sizeof</code> or <code>_Alignof</code> operator whose result is an integer constant), somewhere in the entire
  program there shall be exactly one external definition for the identifier; otherwise, there
  shall be no more than one.</p>
</blockquote>

<hr>

<p>In C++ the concept of <em>linkage</em> is extended: it assigns specific linkage to a much wider variety of entities, including types. In C++ class types have linkage. Classes declared in namespace scope have <em>external linkage</em>. And One Definition Rule of C++ explicitly states that if a class with external linkage has several definitions (across different translation units) it shall be defined equivalently in all of these translation units (<a href=""http://eel.is/c++draft/basic.def.odr#12"" rel=""noreferrer"">http://eel.is/c++draft/basic.def.odr#12</a>). So, in C++ your <code>struct</code> definitions would be illegal.</p>

<p>Your function definitions remain illegal in C++ as well because of C++ ODR rule (but essentially for the same reasons as in C).</p>

<p>What is the true difference between <code>typename = is_ref&lt;T&gt;</code> and <code>is_ref&lt;T&gt; = true</code> ?</p>
","<p>If you remove the default template arguments, it'll become clear what the difference is. Function declarations cannot differ in <em>just</em> their defaults. This is ill-formed:</p>

<pre><code>void foo(int i = 4);
void foo(int i = 5);

<p>The two declarations here are unique because the second template parameter differs between the two declarations.

Those are different types.</p>

void foo(T&amp;&amp;);

","<p>You are mixing three colors in the following order:</p>

<ul>

<p>And you get different results. This is because the foreground color is blended with background color using <a href=""https://www.w3.org/TR/compositing-1/#blendingnormal"" rel=""noreferrer"">normal blend mode</a><sup>1</sup> which is not <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Commutative_property"" rel=""noreferrer""><em>commutative</em></a>. And since it is not commutative, swapping foreground and background colors will produce different result.</p>

<p><sup>1</sup> Blending mode is a function that accepts a foreground and background color, applies some formula and returns the resulting color.</p>

<p>The solution is to use a blending mode that is commutative: one that returns same color for same pair of colors in any order (for example the multiply blend mode, which multiplies both colors and returns the resulting color; or darken blend mode, which returns the darker color of the two).</p>

<p>The example at <a href=""http://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/container/vector"" rel=""noreferrer"">http://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/container/vector</a> uses the second kind, so that got me thinking if this kind of initialization has any advantage.</p>

<p>In general, I want to know if one initialization has a specific technical advantage over the other, or if one initialization is considered best-practice while the other is not, and if so why.</p>

<p>Especially, what I am concerned about is whether the copy-list-initialization has additional overhead due to temporary objects and copying?</p>
","<p>List initialization is informally called ""uniform initialization"" because its meaning and behavior is intended to be the same <em>regardless</em> of how you invoke it.</p>

<p>As such, there is exactly and only <em>one difference</em> between the behavior of direct-list-initialization and copy-list-initialization: if list initialization would call a constructor marked <code>explicit</code>, then there is a compile error if the list-initialization form is copy-list-initialization. That's the only difference.</p>

<p><a href=""http://eel.is/c++draft/dcl.init.list"" rel=""noreferrer"">[dcl.list.init]</a> explains the syntactic difference between direct-list and copy-list. That is, it describes which forms of list-initialization are direct vs. copy. But it never defines any <em>functional difference</em> between the two. </p>

<p>The only part of the standard that defines a behavioral difference is in <a href=""http://eel.is/c++draft/over.match.list"" rel=""noreferrer"">[over.match.list]/1</a>:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>In copy-list-initialization, if an <code>explicit</code> constructor is chosen, the initialization is ill-formed.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>That's a function of overload resolution.</p>

<p>Since the standard defines no behavioral difference, I would be quite surprised indeed if compilers decided to impose some functional difference between them.</p>

<p>How can I enable or find the new project templates for F# desktop applications?</p>
","<p>You can create both WPF and WinForms applications in F#. There is no template for it, but it is certainly possible and many people do this. To create a simple WinForms application, you can do the following:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>Create a new console application. Go to project properties and change ""Output type"" in the ""Application"" page from ""Console application"" to ""Windows Application""</p></li>
<li><p>Right click on ""References"" in the project and add reference to ""System.Windows.Forms"" and ""System.Drawing"" (in the ""Framework"" tab).</p></li>
<li><p>Replace the code in <code>Program.fs</code> with the following:</p>

<pre><code>open System.Windows.Forms

let f = new Form()
f.Controls.Add(new Label(Text=""Hello world!""))
Application.Run(f)
</code></pre></li>
</ul>

<p>For anything bigger, you will probably want to use a nice F# GUI library such as the <a href=""https://github.com/fsprojects/FsXaml"" rel=""noreferrer"">FsXaml</a> project mentioned by Isaac or <a href=""https://reedcopsey.github.io/Gjallarhorn/"" rel=""noreferrer"">Gjallarhorn</a>, but the basic first steps will be the same - create a console project, make it a windows project and then add relevant references to GUI frameworks.</p>

I would think the first two characters are evaluated to ""optional literal parentheses"" except that the parentheses isn't escaped and also in that case I would get a different syntax error because the closing parentheses would then not be matched.</li>
<li>This behavior starts somewhere between Perl 5.16.3_64 and 5.26.1_64, at least in Strawberry Perl. The former version is fine with the code, the latter is not. Why did it start?</li>

    --  ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^ the syntax in question
  where
    j = _sysJacobian cfgPositions
</code></pre>

<p>The relevant definitions of <code>System</code> includes a record <code>{ _sysJacobian :: R n -&gt; L m n }</code>, and <code>{ cfgVelocities :: R n }</code> is part of the record declaration of <code>Config</code> so I believe I know what the code does, I think the code is quite readable, props to the author.</p>

<p>The question is: what is this syntax called and how exactly can I use it?</p>
","<p><strong>In short</strong>: it is an extension of <code>GHC</code> called <a href=""https://ocharles.org.uk/blog/posts/2014-12-04-record-wildcards.html"" rel=""noreferrer""><strong><code>RecordWildCards</code></strong></a>.</p>

<p>In Haskell you can use <a href=""http://learnyouahaskell.com/making-our-own-types-and-typeclasses#record-syntax"" rel=""noreferrer""><em>record syntax</em></a> to define data types. For example:</p>

<pre><code>data Foo = Bar { foo :: Int, bar :: String } | Qux { foo :: Int, qux :: Int }
</code></pre>

<p>We can then pattern match on the data constructor, and match zero or more parameters, for example:</p>

<pre><code>someFunction :: Int -&gt; Foo -&gt; Foo
someFunction dd (Bar {foo=x}) = dd + x
someFunction dd (Qux {foo=x, qux=y}) = dd + x + y
</code></pre>

<p>But it can happen that we need access to a large amount (or even all) parameters. Like for example:</p>

<pre><code>someOtherFunction :: Foo -&gt; Int
someOtherFunction (Bar {foo=foo, bar=bar}) = foo
someOtherFunction (Qux {foo=foo, qux=qux}) = foo + qux
</code></pre>

<p>In case the number of parameters is rather large, then this becomes cumbersome. There is an extension <code>RecordWildCards</code>:</p>

<pre><code>{-# LANGUAGE RecordWildCards #-}
</code></pre>

<p>this will implicitly write for every parameter <code>foo</code>, <code>foo=foo</code> if you write <code>{..}</code> when we do record pattern matching.</p>

<p>So we can then write:</p>

<pre><code>someOtherFunction :: Foo -&gt; Int
someOtherFunction (Bar {..}) = foo
someOtherFunction (Qux {..}) = foo + qux
</code></pre>

<p>So here the compiler implicitly pattern matched all parameters with a variable with the same name, such that we can access those parameters without explicit pattern matching, nor by using getters.</p>

<p>The advantage is thus that we save a lot on large code chunks that have to be written manually. A downside is however the fact that the parameters are no longer <em>explicitly</em> and hence the code is harder to understand. We see the use of parameters for which there exist actually getter counterparts, and thus it can introduce some confusion.</p>

<p>Like @leftroundabout says, probably <a href=""http://hackage.haskell.org/package/lens-tutorial-1.0.3/docs/Control-Lens-Tutorial.html"" rel=""noreferrer""><em>lenses</em></a> can do the trick as well, and it will prevent introducing variables that basically shadow getters, etc.</p>

<p>You can also merge the <code>RecordWildCards</code> with pattern matching on parameters, for example:</p>

<pre><code>someOtherFunction :: Foo -&gt; Int
someOtherFunction (Bar {bar=[], ..}) = foo
someOtherFunction (Bar {..}) = foo + 42
someOtherFunction (Qux {..}) = foo + qux
</code></pre>

<p>So here in case the <code>bar</code> parameter of a <code>Foo</code> instance with a <code>Bar</code> data constructor is the empty string, we return the <code>foo</code> value, otherwise we add <code>42</code> to it.</p>

<p>If you want some intermediary layer, you might also use Oracle AQ, which I personally find more powerful:

<li>This behavior starts somewhere between Perl 5.16.3_64 and 5.26.1_64, at least in Strawberry Perl. The former version is fine with the code, the latter is not. Why did it start?</li>

<p>Due to presence of <code>/i</code> (case insensitive) modifier and presence of certain character combinations such as <code>""ss""</code> or <code>""st""</code> that can be replaced by a <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Special:Search?search=Typographic_ligature"" rel=""noreferrer"">Typographic_ligature</a> causing it to be a variable length (<code>/August/i</code> matches for instance on both <code>AUGUST</code> (6 characters) and <code>auguﬆ</code> (5 characters, the last one being U+FB06)).</p>

<p>However if we remove <code>/i</code> (case insensitive) modifier then it works because typographic ligatures are not matched.</p>

<p><strong>Solution:</strong> Use <code>aa</code> modifiers i.e.:</p>

  <p>To forbid ASCII/non-ASCII matches (like ""k"" with ""\N{KELVIN SIGN}""), specify the ""a"" twice, for example <code>/aai</code> or <code>/aia</code>. (The first occurrence of ""a"" restricts the <code>\d</code>, etc., and the second occurrence adds the ""/i"" restrictions.) But, note that code points outside the ASCII range will use Unicode rules for <code>/i</code> matching, so the modifier doesn't really restrict things to just ASCII; <strong>it just forbids the intermixing of ASCII and non-ASCII</strong>.</p>

Is there any difference between making that variable a private const and just making the variable private, assuming there is no setter function?</p>

<p>Private:</p>

<pre><code>class ConstFoo
{
public:

<p>It seems that there is no difference between the two, since you can't change the value of <code>val_</code> in either case, so the <code>const</code> qualifier seems redundant.</p>

<p>The one reason I can see to explicitly add <code>const</code> is for code clarity, so people working on the code in the future don't add a setter to the function. However, with the name as <code>ConstFoo</code> and documentation specifically stating that it is not meant to be mutable, I don't think this will be an issue.</p>
","<p>It's all a matter of how ""const"" you want this value to be.</p>

<p>As it currently stands, no external user can <em>directly</em> change the value. But they can do so indirectly, because the object itself may not be <code>const</code>:</p>

<pre><code>ConstFoo a{0};
ConstFoo b{2};
a = b;
</code></pre>

<p><code>a</code> now has 2 in it.</p>

<p>Plus, code <em>within</em> <code>ConstFoo</code> can change its value too; this is why the copy assignment operator can change its value.</p>

<p>So if you want to ensure that the specific member object will assume one value throughout the lifetime of any <code>ConstFoo</code> instance, you declare it <code>const</code>.</p>

<p>Of course, this makes <code>ConstFoo</code> non-assignable.</p>

<p><strong>foo.c</strong></p>

<pre><code>struct foo {
   int a;
};
</code></pre>

<p><strong>bar.c</strong></p>

<pre><code>struct foo {
    char a;
};
</code></pre>

<p>But the same thing with functions is illegal:</p>

<p><strong>foo.c</strong></p>

<pre><code>int foo() {
    return 1;
}
</code></pre>

<p><strong>bar.c</strong></p>

<pre><code>int foo() {
    return 0;
}
</code></pre>

<p>and will result in linking error (multiple definition of function <code>foo</code>).</p>

<p>Why is that? What's the difference between struct names and function names that makes C unable to handle one but not the other?
Also does this behavior extend to C++?</p>
","<p>Your function definitions both declare an entity called <code>foo</code> with external linkage, and the C standard says there must not be more than one definition of an entity with external linkage. The struct types you defined are not entities with external linkage, so you can have more than one definition of <code>struct foo</code>.</p>

<p>If you declared objects with external linkage using the same name then that would be an error:</p>

<p>foo.c</p>

<pre><code>struct foo {
   int a;
};
struct foo obj;
</code></pre>

<p>bar.c</p>

<pre><code>struct foo {
    char a;
};
struct foo obj;
</code></pre>

<p>Now you have two objects called <code>obj</code> that both have external linkage, which is not allowed.</p>

<p>It would still be wrong even if one of the objects is only declared, not defined:</p>

<p>foo.c</p>

<pre><code>struct foo {
   int a;
};
struct foo obj;
</code></pre>

<p>bar.c</p>

<pre><code>struct foo {
    char a;
};
extern struct foo obj;
</code></pre>

<p>This is undefined, because the two declarations of <code>obj</code> refer to the same object, but they don't have compatible types (because <code>struct foo</code> is defined differently in each file).</p>

<p>C++ has similar, but more complex rules, to account for <code>inline</code> functions and <code>inline</code> variables, templates, and other C++ features. In C++ the relevant requirements are known as the One-Definition Rule (or ODR). One notable difference is that C++ doesn't even allow the two different <code>struct</code> definitions, even if they are never used to declare objects with external linkage or otherwise ""shared"" between translation units.</p>

<h1>Use single-digit formatting pattern</h1>

<p>You used <code>MM</code> in your formatting pattern, to mean any single-digit value (months January-September) will appear with a padded leading zero.</p>

<p>But your input lacks that padded leading zero. So use a single <code>M</code>.</p>

<p>Ditto for day-of-month I expect: <code>d</code> rather than <code>dd</code>.</p>

<h1>Use only <em>java.time</em></h1>

<p>You are using troublesome flawed old date-time classes (<code>Date</code> &amp; <code>SimpleDateFormat</code>) that were supplanted years ago by the <em>java.time</em> classes. The new classes entirely supplant the old. No need to mix the legacy and modern.</p>

<h2><code>LocalDateTime</code></h2>

<p>Parse as a <a href=""https://docs.oracle.com/javase/10/docs/api/java/time/LocalDateTime.html"" rel=""noreferrer""><code>LocalDateTime</code></a> because your input string lacks any indicator of <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Time_zone"" rel=""noreferrer"">time zone</a> or <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UTC_offset"" rel=""noreferrer"">offset-from-UTC</a>. Such a value is <em>not</em> a moment, is <em>not</em> a point on the timeline. It is only a set of <em>potential</em> moments along a range of about 26-27 hours.</p>

<pre><code>String input = ""04:30 PM, Sat 5/12/2018"";
DateTimeFormatter f = DateTimeFormatter.ofPattern( ""hh:mm a, EEE M/d/uuuu"" , Locale.US );  // Specify locale to determine human language and cultural norms used in translating that input string.
LocalDateTime ldt = LocalDateTime.parse( input , f );
</code></pre>

<blockquote>
  <p>ldt.toString(): 2018-05-12T16:30</p>
</blockquote>

<h2><code>ZonedDateTime</code></h2>

<p>If you know for certain that input was intended to represent a moment using the wall-clock time used by the people of the Toronto Canada region, apply a <code>ZoneId</code> to get a <a href=""https://docs.oracle.com/javase/10/docs/api/java/time/ZonedDateTime.html"" rel=""noreferrer""><code>ZonedDateTime</code></a> object.</p>

<p>Assigning a time zone gives meaning to your unzoned <code>LocalDateTime</code>. Now we have a moment, a point on the timeline.</p>

<pre><code>ZoneId z = ZoneId.of( ""America/Toronto"" ) ;
ZonedDateTime zdt = ldt.atZone( z ) ;  // Give meaning to that `LocalDateTime` by assigning the context of a particular time zone. Now we have a moment, a point on the timeline.
</code></pre>

<blockquote>
  <p>zdt.toString(): 2018-05-12T16:30-04:00[America/Toronto]</p>
</blockquote>

<h2><code>Instant</code></h2>

<p>To see that same moment as <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coordinated_Universal_Time"" rel=""noreferrer"">UTC</a>, extract an <a href=""https://docs.oracle.com/javase/10/docs/api/java/time/Instant.html"" rel=""noreferrer""><code>Instant</code></a>. Same moment, different wall-clock time.</p>

<pre><code>Instant instant = zdt.toInstant() ;
</code></pre>

<blockquote>
  <p>instant.toString(): 2018-05-12T20:30:00Z</p>

I was told that this is true for larger types because the CPU can not atomically change the data without using some sort of lock.  </p>

<p>for example:</p>

<pre><code>#include &lt;iostream&gt;
#include &lt;atomic&gt;

struct foo {
    double a;
    double b;
};

std::atomic&lt;foo&gt; var;

int main()
{
    std::cout &lt;&lt; var.is_lock_free() &lt;&lt; std::endl;
    std::cout &lt;&lt; sizeof(foo) &lt;&lt; std::endl;
    std::cout &lt;&lt; sizeof(var) &lt;&lt; std::endl;
}
</code></pre>

<p>the output (Linux/gcc) is:</p>

<pre><code>0
16
16
</code></pre>

<p>Since the atomic and <code>foo</code> are the same size, I don't think a lock is stored in the atomic.</p>

<p>My question is:<br>
If an atomic variable uses a lock, where is it stored and what does that mean for multiple instances of that variable ?</p>
","<p><strong>The usual implementation is a hash-table of mutexes (or even just simple spinlocks without a fallback to OS-assisted sleep/wakeup), using the address of the atomic object as a key</strong>.  The hash function might be as simple as just using the low bits of the address as an index into a power-of-2 sized array, but @Frank's answer shows LLVM's std::atomic implementation does XOR in some higher bits so you don't automatically get aliasing when objects are separated by a large power of 2 (which is more common than any other random arrangement).</p>

<p>I think (but I'm not sure) that g++ and clang++ are ABI-compatible; i.e. that they use the same hash function and table, so they agree on which lock serializes access to which object.  The locking is all done in <code>libatomic</code>, though, so if you dynamically link <code>libatomic</code> then all code inside the same program that calls <code>__atomic_store_16</code> will use the same implementation; clang++ and g++ definitely agree on which function names to call, and that's enough.  (But note that <strong>only lock-free atomic objects in shared memory between different processes will work: each process has its own hash table of locks</strong>.  Lock-free objects are supposed to (and in fact do) Just Work in shared memory on normal CPU architectures, even if the region is mapped to different addresses.)</p>

<p><strong>Hash collisions mean that two atomic objects might share the same lock.  This is not a correctness problem, but it could be a performance problem</strong>: instead of two pairs of threads separately contending with each other for two different objects, you could have all 4 threads contending for access to either object.  Presumably that's unusual, and usually you aim for your atomic objects to be lock-free on the platforms you care about.  But most of the time you don't get really unlucky, and it's basically fine.</p>

<p><strong>Deadlocks aren't possible</strong> because there aren't any <code>std::atomic</code> functions that try to take the lock on two objects at once.  So the library code that takes the lock never tries to take another lock while holding one of these locks.  Extra contention / serialization is not a correctness problem, just performance.</p>

<hr>

<p><strong>x86-64 16-byte objects with GCC vs. MSVC</strong>:</p>

<p>As a hack, compilers can use <code>lock cmpxchg16b</code> to implement 16-byte atomic load/store, as well as actual read-modify-write operations.</p>

<p>This is better than locking, but has bad performance compared to 8-byte atomic objects (e.g. pure loads contend with other loads).  It's the only documented safe way to atomically do anything with 16 bytes<sup>1</sup>.</p>

<p>AFAIK, MSVC never uses <code>lock cmpxchg16b</code> for 16-byte objects, and they're basically the same as a 24 or 32 byte object.</p>

<p>gcc6 and earlier inlined <a href=""http://felixcloutier.com/x86/CMPXCHG8B:CMPXCHG16B.html"" rel=""noreferrer""><code>lock cmpxchg16b</code></a> when you compile with <code>-mcx16</code> (cmpxchg16b unfortunately isn't baseline for x86-64; first-gen AMD K8 CPUs are missing it.)</p>

<p>gcc7 decided to always call <code>libatomic</code> and never report 16-byte objects as lock-free, even though libatomic functions would still use <code>lock cmpxchg16b</code> on machines where the instruction is available.  See <a href=""https://stackoverflow.com/questions/49816855/is-lock-free-returned-false-after-upgrading-to-macports-gcc-7-3"">is_lock_free() returned false after upgrading to MacPorts gcc 7.3</a>.  The gcc mailing list message explaining this change <a href=""https://gcc.gnu.org/ml/gcc-patches/2017-01/msg02344.html"" rel=""noreferrer"">is here</a>.</p>

<p>You can use a union hack to get a reasonably cheap ABA pointer+counter on x86-64 with gcc/clang: <a href=""https://stackoverflow.com/questions/38984153/how-can-i-implement-aba-counter-with-c11-cas"">How can I implement ABA counter with c++11 CAS?</a>.  <code>lock cmpxchg16b</code> for updates of both pointer and counter, but simple <code>mov</code> loads of just the pointer.  This only works if the 16-byte object is actually lock-free using <code>lock cmpxchg16b</code>, though.</p>

<hr>

<p><strong>Footnote 1</strong>:   <code>movdqa</code> 16-byte load/store is atomic in practice on some (but <em>not</em> all) x86 microarchitectures, and there's no reliable or documented way to detect when it's usable.  See <a href=""https://stackoverflow.com/questions/36624881/why-is-integer-assignment-on-a-naturally-aligned-variable-atomic-on-x86"">Why is integer assignment on a naturally aligned variable atomic on x86?</a>, and <a href=""https://stackoverflow.com/questions/7646018/sse-instructions-which-cpus-can-do-atomic-16b-memory-operations/7647825#7647825"">SSE instructions: which CPUs can do atomic 16B memory operations?</a> for an example where K10 Opteron shows tearing at 8B boundaries only between sockets with HyperTransport.</p>

<p>So compiler writers have to err on the side of caution and can't use <code>movdqa</code> the way they use SSE2 <code>movq</code> for 8-byte atomic load/store in 32-bit code.  It would be great if CPU vendors could document some guarantees for some microarchitectures, or add CPUID feature bits for atomic 16, 32, and 64-byte aligned vector load/store (with SSE, AVX, and AVX512).  Maybe which mobo vendors could disable in firmware on funky many-socket machines that use special coherency glue chips that don't transfer whole cache lines atomically.</p>

<pre><code>pojoList.stream()
        .reduce(0, (myObject1, myObject2) -&gt; (myObject1.getA() + myObject2.getB()));
</code></pre>
","<p>Well, if you want to call reduce on the <code>IntStream</code>:</p>

<pre><code>int sum = pojoList.stream()
                  .mapToInt(ob -&gt;(ob.getA()+ob.getB()))
                  .reduce(0, (a,b)-&gt;a+b);
</code></pre>

<p>Of course, the same will work on a <code>Stream&lt;Integer&gt;</code>:</p>

<pre><code>int sum = pojoList.stream()
                  .map(ob -&gt;(ob.getA()+ob.getB()))
                  .reduce(0, (a,b)-&gt;a+b);
</code></pre>

<p>or with a method reference:</p>

<pre><code>int sum = pojoList.stream()
                  .map(ob -&gt;(ob.getA()+ob.getB()))
                  .reduce(0, Integer::sum);
</code></pre>

<p>or without the <code>map()</code>:</p>

<pre><code>int sum = pojoList.stream()
                  .reduce(0, (s,ob)-&gt;s+ob.getA()+ob.getB(),Integer::sum);
</code></pre>

<p>In this last example, I use the variant:</p>

<pre><code>&lt;U&gt; U reduce(U identity,
             BiFunction&lt;U, ? super T, U&gt; accumulator,
             BinaryOperator&lt;U&gt; combiner);
</code></pre>

<p>since the reduced value (an <code>Integer</code>) is different than the type of the <code>Stream</code> elements. </p>

<p>The first parameter is an identity value - 0.</p>

<p>The second parameter adds the <code>getA()</code> and <code>getB()</code> values of the current <code>Pojo</code> element to the intermediate sum.</p>

<p>The third parameter combines two partial sums.</p>

I would naively expect it to be applicable to any superclass of <code>SomeClass</code> up the hierarchy, including <code>Object</code>.</p>

<p>However this predicate is not applicable to <code>Object</code>. I get the following error:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>The method test(capture#3-of ? super SomeClass) in the type Predicate is not applicable for the arguments (Object)</p>
</blockquote>

<p><a href=""https://ideone.com/pTxzvl"" rel=""noreferrer"">Demo</a>.</p>

<p>Why is <code>Predicate&lt;? super SomeClass&gt;</code> not applicable to an instance of <code>Object</code>?</p>

<p>The code:</p>

<pre><code>import java.util.*;
import java.lang.*;
import java.io.*;
import java.net.URL;
import java.util.function.Predicate;


/* Name of the class has to be ""Main"" only if the class is public. */
class Ideone

    public static void main (String[] args) throws java.lang.Exception
    {
        Predicate&lt;? super URL&gt; p = u -&gt; u.getFile().isEmpty();
        p.test(new Object());
    }
}
</code></pre>
","<p>For a <code>Predicate&lt;? super SomeClass&gt;</code> variable, you can assign a <code>Predicate&lt;SomeClass&gt;</code> instance, or a <code>Predicate&lt;Object&gt;</code> instance.</p>

<p>However, you can't pass an <code>Object</code> to the <code>test()</code> method of a <code>Predicate&lt;SomeClass&gt;</code>. You can only pass a <code>SomeClass</code> instance.</p>

<p>Therefore you can't pass an <code>Object</code> to the <code>test()</code> method of a <code>Predicate&lt;? super SomeClass&gt;</code></p>

<p>Consider the following:</p>

<pre><code>Predicate&lt;URL&gt; p1 = u -&gt; u.getFile().isEmpty();
Predicate&lt;? super URL&gt; p2 = p1;
</code></pre>

<p><code>p2</code> is referring to a <code>Predicate&lt;URL&gt;</code>, so you can't pass a <code>new Object()</code> to its <code>test()</code> method.</p>

<p>In other words, in order for <code>p.test(new Object())</code> to be accepted by the compiler, it must be valid for <strong>any</strong> <code>Predicate</code> that can be assigned to the <code>Predicate&lt;? super URL&gt; p</code> variable. Since the <code>Predicate&lt;URL&gt;</code> <code>Predicate</code> can be assigned to that variable, and its <code>test()</code> method <strong>cannot</strong> accept an <code>Object</code>, <code>p.test(new Object())</code> cannot be accepted by the compiler. </p>

<p>BTW, in your specific example, you are creating a <code>Predicate&lt;URL&gt;</code>, and <code>URL</code> is a final class. Therefore, you should simply declare it as:</p>

<pre><code>Predicate&lt;URL&gt; p = u -&gt; u.getFile().isEmpty();
</code></pre>

<p>There's no reason for <code>? super</code> or <code>? extends</code>.</p>

","772035","772035","110868","<p>For years Bitcoin adoption has been slower than expected, because Bitcoin has been becoming unnecessarily complex in the guise of avoiding hard forks. On August 1, 2017 that changed when Bitcoin hardforked to implement the first substantial network upgrade in many years. The hardfork was contentious, causing a split where both the non-forked and forked version of the coin continue to exist. The legacy version has financial backing by big banks that want to slow bitcoin adoption and has kept the name Bitcoin.</p>

<p>The upgraded version is now called Bitcoin Cash and will hardfork (non-contentiously) on a regular interval every six months, allowing the network to be upgraded without catching any node operators off guard. In the first hardfork Bitcoin Cash removed RBF so that merchants can now accept unconfirmed transactions, and increased the block size so that it can scale to support more transactions and have lower fees. The next upgrade will fix TX malleability in a much simpler way than segwit does (segwit is needlessly complex in order to avoid a hardfork) and fix it for all transactions instead of only fixing it only for segwit transactions. Many more exciting upgrades will be rolled out in the biannual hardforks.</p>

<p>You would say that the JVM should load and initialize class <code>Hello</code> when you access <code>Hello.x</code> in class <code>Test4</code>. However, that doesn't happen here, because this is a special case.</p>

<p><code>static final</code> constants are inlined by the compiler - which means that when this code is compiled, the <code>Hello.x</code> in the <code>main</code> method is replaced at compilation time by the value of the constant, which is <code>10</code>. Essentially, your code compiles to the same byte code as when you would compile this:</p>

<pre><code>use strict;

    #This is not numeric

<p>It seems what's <em>actually</em> happening is that Perl advances to the next comparison, <code>while ($choice == 0){</code>, but the line counter used for the warning message does not advance.</p>

<p>What makes this particular case worse is that, since the ""bad"" comparison is the loop condition, it is actually far away from the provided line. In my (pre-simplification) script, it was hundreds of lines away from the provided line number.</p>

<p>Is this a bug or just an unfortunate limitation of the parser?</p>
","<p>It would be expensive to store the location of each operator instance. As a compromise, Perl only tracks the location of statements. It does so by adding a location-setting opcode at the start of every statement. The <code>if</code> statement is the last statement to be started before <code>$choice == 0</code> is performed, so the warning is reported as coming from that line.</p>

","<p>The exception (whatever it was) <em>was</em> caught by <code>catch (Exception e)</code>.  You didn't log this exception, so you don't know what it was.  You should log it somehow so you know what really happened.</p>

<p>The problem occurs when you return <code>-1</code>.  This allows for the possibility of inconsistent ordering, which Java's current sorting algorithm sometimes catches.  In short, returning <code>-1</code> on an error means that you are asserting that both <code>a &lt; b</code> and <code>b &lt; a</code> are true, because the exception will be caught in both cases. This is logically incorrect.  The sorting algorithm detects this and throws the <code>IllegalArgumentException</code>.  Note that the <code>compare</code> method is <em>not</em> in your stack trace; it's the call to <code>Collections.sort</code>.</p>

<p>In addition to logging the exception, handle it before you even get to the comparison step in your program.  If you have to parse the string as an integer, do that when creating the <code>Employee</code> objects, so that the validation occurs before you even get to the sorting step in your program.  A <code>Comparator</code> shouldn't have to validate data; it should only compare the data.</p>

<h3>An algorithm for getting random values without a list of all possible combinations</h3>

<p>It works by using a factor for the random value and an offset, based on the actual sum, index, minimum sum which is needed for the next index and the maximum sum.</p>

<p>The offset is usually the minimum sum, or the greater value of the difference of sum and maximum sum. For getting the factor, three values are taken for the minimum for multiplying the random value.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>The table illustrates all possible values of the sum and the needed iterations, based on a given value and the iteration for getting all values.</p>
  
  <p>At the beginning the sum is the value for distribution in small parts. The result is the second block with a rest sum of <code>14</code> ... <code>10</code>, because it is possible to take a value of <code>1</code> ... <code>5</code>. The third round follows the same rules. At the end, the leftover sum is taken as offset for the value.</p>

<p>The <code>locals()</code> will be contain 2**17 variables but you cannot do something like <code>print(var_100)</code> inside the function. </p>

<blockquote>

</blockquote>

<p>Yes, you can make a <strong>non-thread-safe</strong> <code>HashMap</code> very easily in Java. Rust doesn't want to make it easy to create code that can lead to memory unsafety. You need to protect the type with appropriate safety, such as by a <code>Mutex</code>, or you need to dip into <code>unsafe</code> code if <em>you the programmer</em> guarantee that a global value will only ever be used by one thread.</p>

<ol>
<li><code>withContext(context)</code>: switches the context of the current coroutine, when the given block executes, the coroutine switches back to previous context.</li>

","<blockquote>
  <p>Large number of coroutines, though lightweight, could still be a problem in demanding applications</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I'd like to dispel this myth of ""too many coroutines"" being a problem by quantifying their actual cost.</p>

<p>First, we should disentangle the <em>coroutine</em> itself from the <em>coroutine context</em> to which it is attached. This is how you create just a coroutine with minimum overhead:</p>

<pre><code>GlobalScope.launch(Dispatchers.Unconfined) {
    suspendCoroutine&lt;Unit&gt; {
        continuations.add(it)
    }
}
</code></pre>

<p>The value of this expression is a <code>Job</code> holding a suspended coroutine. To retain the continuation, we added it to a list in the wider scope.</p>

<p>I benchmarked this code and concluded that it allocates <strong>140 bytes</strong> and takes <strong>100 nanoseconds</strong> to complete. So that's how lightweight a coroutine is. </p>

<p>For reproducibility, this is the code I used:</p>

<pre><code>fun measureMemoryOfLaunch() {
    val continuations = ContinuationList()
    val jobs = (1..10_000).mapTo(JobList()) {
        GlobalScope.launch(Dispatchers.Unconfined) {
            suspendCoroutine&lt;Unit&gt; {
                continuations.add(it)
            }
        }
    }
    (1..500).forEach {
        Thread.sleep(1000)
        println(it)
    }
    println(jobs.onEach { it.cancel() }.filter { it.isActive})
}

class JobList : ArrayList&lt;Job&gt;()

class ContinuationList : ArrayList&lt;Continuation&lt;Unit&gt;&gt;()
</code></pre>

<p>This code starts a bunch of coroutines and then sleeps so you have time to analyze the heap with a monitoring tool like VisualVM. I created the specialized classes <code>JobList</code> and <code>ContinuationList</code> because this makes it easier to analyze the heap dump.</p>

<hr>

<p>To get a more complete story, I used the code below to also measure the cost of <code>withContext()</code> and <code>async-await</code>:</p>

<pre><code>import kotlinx.coroutines.*
import java.util.concurrent.Executors
import kotlin.coroutines.suspendCoroutine
import kotlin.system.measureTimeMillis

const val JOBS_PER_BATCH = 100_000

var blackHoleCount = 0
val threadPool = Executors.newSingleThreadExecutor()!!
val ThreadPool = threadPool.asCoroutineDispatcher()

fun main(args: Array&lt;String&gt;) {
    try {
        measure(""just launch"", justLaunch)
        measure(""launch and withContext"", launchAndWithContext)
        measure(""launch and async"", launchAndAsync)
        println(""Black hole value: $blackHoleCount"")
    } finally {
        threadPool.shutdown()
    }
}

fun measure(name: String, block: (Int) -&gt; Job) {
    print(""Measuring $name, warmup "")
    (1..1_000_000).forEach { block(it).cancel() }
    println(""done."")
    System.gc()
    System.gc()
    val tookOnAverage = (1..20).map { _ -&gt;
        System.gc()
        System.gc()
        var jobs: List&lt;Job&gt; = emptyList()
        measureTimeMillis {
            jobs = (1..JOBS_PER_BATCH).map(block)
        }.also { _ -&gt;
            blackHoleCount += jobs.onEach { it.cancel() }.count()
        }
    }.average()
    println(""$name took ${tookOnAverage * 1_000_000 / JOBS_PER_BATCH} nanoseconds"")
}

fun measureMemory(name:String, block: (Int) -&gt; Job) {
    println(name)
    val jobs = (1..JOBS_PER_BATCH).map(block)
    (1..500).forEach {
        Thread.sleep(1000)
        println(it)
    }
    println(jobs.onEach { it.cancel() }.filter { it.isActive})
}

val justLaunch: (i: Int) -&gt; Job = {
    GlobalScope.launch(Dispatchers.Unconfined) {
        suspendCoroutine&lt;Unit&gt; {}
    }
}

val launchAndWithContext: (i: Int) -&gt; Job = {
    GlobalScope.launch(Dispatchers.Unconfined) {
        withContext(ThreadPool) {
            suspendCoroutine&lt;Unit&gt; {}
        }
    }
}

val launchAndAsync: (i: Int) -&gt; Job = {
    GlobalScope.launch(Dispatchers.Unconfined) {
        async(ThreadPool) {
            suspendCoroutine&lt;Unit&gt; {}
        }.await()
    }
}
</code></pre>

<p>This is the typical output I get from the above code:</p>

<pre><code>Just launch: 140 nanoseconds
launch and withContext : 520 nanoseconds
launch and async-await: 1100 nanoseconds
</code></pre>

<p>Yes, <code>async-await</code> takes about twice as long as <code>withContext</code>, but it's still less than a microsecond. You'd have to launch them in a tight loop, doing almost nothing besides, for that to become ""a problem"" in your app.</p>

<p>Using <code>measureMemory()</code> I found the following memory cost per call:</p>

<pre><code>Just launch: 88 bytes
withContext(): 512 bytes
async-await: 652 bytes
</code></pre>

<p>The cost of <code>async-await</code> is exactly 140 bytes higher than <code>withContext</code>, the number we got as the memory weight of one coroutine. This is just a fraction of the complete cost of setting up the <code>CommonPool</code> context.</p>

<p>If performance/memory impact was the only criterion to decide between <code>withContext</code> and <code>async-await</code>, the conclusion would have to be that there's no relevant difference between them in 99% of real use cases.</p>

<p>The real reason is that <code>withContext()</code> a simpler and more direct API that you should prefer whenever it fits you semantically. It also happens to be optimized, leveraging the fact that you'll immediately suspend the parent coroutine and await on the child, but that's just an added bonus.</p>

<p><code>async-await</code> should be reserved for those cases where you actually want concurrency, so that you launch several coroutines in the background and only then await on them. In short:</p>

<ul>
<li><code>async-await-async-await</code> &mdash; same as <code>withContext-withContext</code></li>
<li><code>async-async-await-await</code> &mdash; that's the way to use it.</li>

</code></pre>

<p>is fine. I somewhat understand how they are different, but I would like to know why the choice was made to make them different. What is the danger in assignment not being the same as reset?</p>
","<p>Firstly, <code>std::unique_ptr&lt;MyClass&gt; p = new MyClass;</code> is not assignment, it is <a href=""http://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/language/copy_initialization"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">copy initialization</a>. And it doesn't work because the <a href=""https://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/memory/unique_ptr/unique_ptr"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">constructor of <code>std::unique</code></a> taking a raw pointer is marked as <code>explicit</code>:</p>

<blockquote>
<pre><code>explicit unique_ptr( pointer p ) noexcept;
</code></pre>
</blockquote>

<p>It is declared as <code>explicit</code> to avoid dangerous (unexpected) <strong>implicit</strong> conversions, eg:</p>

<pre><code>void foo(std::unique_ptr&lt;int&gt; uptr);

int *rptr = new int;
foo(rptr); // suppose rptr is implicitly converted to std::unique_ptr&lt;int&gt;
           // then the ownership is passed to the parameter uptr

// when foo() returns uptr is destroyed; the pointer managed by it is deleted too
// since rptr has been deleted continue to deference on it leads to UB
*rptr = 42; // UB
</code></pre>

<p>Note that <code>explicit</code> constructors are not considered in <a href=""https://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/language/copy_initialization"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">copy initialization</a> (eg <code>std::unique_ptr&lt;MyClass&gt; p = new MyClass;</code>). You can use them in <a href=""https://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/language/direct_initialization"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">direct initialization</a> instead (eg <code>std::unique_ptr&lt;MyClass&gt; p (new MyClass);</code>). They are used to prohibit implicit conversions, but you can perform explicit conversions. Like the usage of <code>reset</code>, you have to do these things <strong>explicitly</strong>, to show (and make yourself) that you're pretty sure about what you're doing.</p>

<p>BTW: The assignment from raw pointer doesn't work either, because <code>std::unique_ptr</code> doesn't have an overloaded assignment operator taking a raw pointer as parameter. For the reason above, raw pointer can't be <strong>implicitly</strong> converted to <code>std::unique_ptr</code>, so the move assignment operator (which takes <code>std::unique_ptr</code> as parameter) won't be considered either.</p>

<p>In general, allocating space for the elements of a container can throw an exception (which would be a <code>std::bad_alloc</code>). But the default constructor of a <code>std::vector</code> does not <strong>need</strong> to allocate any such space; it can lazily allocate some space on the first insertion or assignment.

2) a = b + a; a++
3) a = b + a, a++

<p>Everyone knows that example 1 is a Very Bad Thing, and clearly invokes undefined behavior. Example 2 has no problems. My question is regarding example 3. Does the comma operator work like a semicolon in this kind of expression? Are 2 and 3 equivalent or is 3 just as undefined as 1?</p>

<p>Specifically I was considering this regarding something like <code>free(foo), foo = bar</code>. This is basically the same problem as above. Can I be sure that foo is freed before it's reassigned, or is this a clear sequence point problem?</p>

<p>I am aware that both examples are largely pointless and it makes far more sense to just use a semicolon and be done with it. I'm just asking out of curiosity.</p>
","<p><code>a = b + a, a++;</code> is well-defined, but <code>a = (b + a, a++);</code> can be undefined.</p>

<p>First of all, the operator precedence makes the expression equivalent to <code>(a = (b+a)), a++;</code>, where <code>+</code> has the highest precedence, followed by <code>=</code>, followed by <code>,</code>. The comma operator includes a sequence point between the evaluation of its left and right operand. So the code is, uninterestingly, completely equivalent to:</p>

<pre><code>a = b + a;
a++;
</code></pre>

<p>Which is of course well-defined.</p>

<hr>

<p>Had we instead written <code>a = (b + a, a++);</code>, then the sequence point in the comma operator wouldn't save the day. Because then the expression would have been equivalent to</p>

<pre><code>(void)(b + a);
a = a++;
</code></pre>

<ul>
<li>In C and C++14 or older, <code>a = a++</code> is unsequenced , (see C11 6.5.16/3). Meaning this is undefined behavior (Per C11 6.5/2). Note that C++11 and C++14 were badly formulated and ambiguous.</li>
<li>In C++17 or later, the operands of the <code>=</code> operator are sequenced right to left and this is still well-defined.</li>
</ul>

<p>All of this assuming no C++ operator overloading takes place. In that case, the parameters to the overloaded operator function will be evaluated, a sequence point takes place before the function is called, and what happens from there depends on the internals of that function.</p>

<li><strong>2</strong> in <em>4%</em> of cases,  </li>
<li>between <strong>3</strong> and <strong>255</strong> in
the other <em>1%</em> of cases?</li>
</ul>

<p>So, is there anything better than a <code>uint8_t</code> array to use for this? It should be as quick as possible to loop over the whole array in a random order, and this is very heavy on RAM bandwidth, so when having more than a few threads doing that at the same time for different arrays, currently the whole RAM bandwidth is quickly saturated.</p>

<p>I'm asking since it feels very inefficient to have such a big array (10 MB) when it's actually known that almost all values, apart from 5%, will be either 0 or 1. So when 95% of all values in the array would only actually need 1 bit instead of 8 bit, this would reduce memory usage by almost an order of magnitude. 
It feels like there has to be a more memory efficient solution that would greatly reduce RAM bandwidth required for this, and as a result also be significantly quicker for random access.</p>
","<p>A simple possibility that comes to mind is to keep a compressed array of 2 bits per value for the common cases, and a separated 4 byte per value (24 bit for original element index, 8 bit for actual value, so <code>(idx &lt;&lt; 8) | value)</code>) sorted array for the other ones.</p>

<p>When you look up a value, you first do a lookup in the 2bpp array (O(1)); if you find 0, 1 or 2 it's the value you want; if you find 3 it means that you have to look it up in the secondary array. Here you'll perform a binary search to look for the <em>index</em> of your interest left-shifted by 8 (O(log(n) with a small n, as this should be the 1%), and extract the value from the 4-byte thingie.</p>

<pre><code>std::vector&lt;uint8_t&gt; main_arr;
std::vector&lt;uint32_t&gt; sec_arr;

uint8_t lookup(unsigned idx) {
    // extract the 2 bits of our interest from the main array
    uint8_t v = (main_arr[idx&gt;&gt;2]&gt;&gt;(2*(idx&amp;3)))&amp;3;
    // usual (likely) case: value between 0 and 2
    if(v != 3) return v;
    // bad case: lookup the index&lt;&lt;8 in the secondary array
    // lower_bound finds the first &gt;=, so we don't need to mask out the value
    auto ptr = std::lower_bound(sec_arr.begin(), sec_arr.end(), idx&lt;&lt;8);
#ifdef _DEBUG
    // some coherency checks
    if(ptr == sec_arr.end()) std::abort();
    if((*ptr &gt;&gt; 8) != idx) std::abort();
#endif
    // extract our 8-bit value from the 32 bit (index, value) thingie
    return (*ptr) &amp; 0xff;
}

void populate(uint8_t *source, size_t size) {
    main_arr.clear(); sec_arr.clear();
    // size the main storage (round up)
    main_arr.resize((size+3)/4);
    for(size_t idx = 0; idx &lt; size; ++idx) {
        uint8_t in = source[idx];
        uint8_t &amp;target = main_arr[idx&gt;&gt;2];
        // if the input doesn't fit, cap to 3 and put in secondary storage
        if(in &gt;= 3) {
            // top 24 bits: index; low 8 bit: value
            sec_arr.push_back((idx &lt;&lt; 8) | in);
            in = 3;
        }
        // store in the target according to the position
        target |= in &lt;&lt; ((idx &amp; 3)*2);
    }
}
</code></pre>

<p>For an array such as the one you proposed, this should take 10000000 / 4 = 2500000 bytes for the first array, plus 10000000 * 1% * 4 B = 400000 bytes for the second array; hence 2900000 bytes, i.e. less than one third of the original array, and the most used portion is all kept together in memory, which should be good for caching (it may even fit L3).</p>

<p>If you need more than 24-bit addressing, you'll have to tweak the ""secondary storage""; a trivial way to extend it is to have a 256 element pointer array to switch over the top 8 bits of the index and forward to a 24-bit indexed sorted array as above. </p>

<p>The code above populates a 10M element array with random data distributed as OP specified in their post, initializes my data structure and then:</p>

<ul>
<li>performs a random lookup of 10M elements with my data structure</li>
<li>does the same through the original array.</li>
</ul>

<p>(notice that in case of sequential lookup the array always wins by a huge measure, as it's the most cache-friendly lookup you can do)</p>

<p>These last two blocks are repeated 50 times and timed; at the end, the mean and standard deviation for each type of lookup are calculated and printed, along with the speedup (lookup_mean/array_mean).</p>

<p>I compiled the code above with g++ 5.4.0 (<code>-O3 -static</code>, plus some warnings) on Ubuntu 16.04, and ran it on some machines; most of them are running Ubuntu 16.04, some some older Linux, some some newer Linux. I don't think the OS should be relevant at all in this case.</p>

<p>The results are... mixed!</p>

<ol>
<li>In general, on most of these machines there is some kind of speedup, or at least they are on a par.</li>
<li>The two cases where the array truly trumps the ""smart structure"" lookup are on a machines with lots of cache and not particularly busy: the Xeon E5-1650 above (15 MB cache) is a night build machine, at the moment quite idle; the Xeon E5-2697 (35 MB cache) is a machine for high performance calculations, in an idle moment as well. It does make sense, the original array fits completely in their huge cache, so the compact data structure only adds complexity.</li>
<li>At the opposite side of the ""performance spectrum"" - but where again the array is slightly faster, there's the humble Celeron that powers my NAS; it has so little cache that neither the array nor the ""smart structure"" fits in it at all. Other machines with cache small enough perform similarly.</li>
<li>The Xeon X5650 must be taken with some caution - they are virtual machines on a quite busy dual-socket virtual machine server; it may well be that, although nominally it has a decent amount of cache, during the time of the test it gets preempted by completely unrelated virtual machines several times.</li>

<p>i.e with a <code>std::list</code> the only sort available is via a method (<a href=""http://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/container/list/sort"" rel=""noreferrer"">http://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/container/list/sort</a>), I would like to be able to sort part of a list from its iterators using <code>std::sort</code>.

<pre><code>std::sort(listItrStart, listItrEnd, [](T&amp; a, T&amp; b){ return a.something() &lt; b.something()});

<p>I appreciate that iterators would become invalidated once a move operation is done on an item, which I assume means that a list cannot be sorted by iterators without re-iterating to the desired location before the next 'compare'?</p>

<p>In which case what is the best practice for sorting subsests of lists without populating another container for this process (if any)?</p>

<p>Many thanks.</p>
","<p>Populating another container is unavoidable. But you don't have to move or copy any of your own data. You can use <a href=""http://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/container/list/splice"" rel=""noreferrer""><code>std::list::splice</code></a> to extract and reinsert the nodes you want to process into sorted order.</p>

<pre><code>using list_t = std::list&lt;widget&gt;;
void process(list_t&amp; in, list_t::const_iterator begin, list_t::const_iterator end) {
  list_t sorter;
  sorter.splice(sorter.end(), in, begin, end);
  sorter.sort();
  in.splice(end, sorter);
}
</code></pre>

<p>The function transfers the nodes you wish to sort into the sorter list (the first iterator argument is the position before which the nodes are inserted, in this case the end of the list).</p>

<p>The sorter list is sorted (obviously), and then the sorted content is transferred back into the source list, exactly into the original sub-range it originally populated.</p>

<hr>

<p>As commented by @T.C. The next step is to generalize it. It can be made into a template much like this one:</p>

<pre><code>template&lt;class List, class Compare = std::less&lt;&gt;&gt;
void sort_subrange(List&amp; in,
                   typename List::const_iterator begin,
                   typename List::const_iterator end,
                   Compare c = {}) {
  List sorter(in.get_allocator());
  sorter.splice(sorter.end(), in, begin, end);

  [[maybe_unused]] ScopeGuard sg([&amp;]() { in.splice(end, sorter); }); 
  sorter.sort(std::move(c));
}
</code></pre>

<p>The comparator is taken as an argument here as well, and <code>sorter</code> is constructed with a copy of the input's allocator for maximum genericity. The splicing back is done in a scope guard of our choosing to support the case where the compare function throws, so our bases are now covered. </p>

<p><a href=""http://coliru.stacked-crooked.com/a/fb44574dbbb07662"" rel=""noreferrer"">Here is a live example</a>, with a naive and somewhat silly implementation of a scope guard, for exposition purposes.</p>

};


int main() {
    RecursiveVariant&lt;int, std::map&lt;int, recursive_tag&gt;&gt; rv; 
}
</code></pre>

<p>This fails to compile on gcc 7/8 due to trying to instantiate <code>std::pair&lt;const int, recursive_tag&gt;</code>, which itself fails because <code>recursive_tag</code> is an incomplete type. </p>

<p>But, nothing in the compiler error call-stack indicates to me <em>why</em> <code>std::pair&lt;const int, recursive_tag&gt;</code> needs to be instantiated. The top line there is:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>variant:252:48:   required from ‘<code>void std::__detail::__variant::__erased_dtor(_Variant&amp;&amp;) [with _Variant = const std::__detail::__variant::_Variant_storage&lt;false, int, std::map&lt;int, RecursiveVariant&lt;int, std::map&lt;int, recursive_tag, std::less&lt;int&gt;, std::allocator&lt;std::pair&lt;const int, recursive_tag&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;, std::less&lt;int&gt;, std::allocator&lt;std::pair&lt;const int, RecursiveVariant&lt;int, std::map&lt;int, recursive_tag, std::less&lt;int&gt;, std::allocator&lt;std::pair&lt;const int, recursive_tag&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&amp;; long unsigned int _Np = 0]</code>’</p>

</code></pre>

<p>While type <code>map&lt;int, recursive_tag&gt;</code> is spelled in there, the actual <code>map</code> type that should be instantiated is <code>map&lt;int, RecursiveVariant&lt;int, map&lt;int, recursive_tag&gt;&gt;&gt;</code>... which should only necessitate the instantiation of <code>pair&lt;const int, RecursiveVariant&lt;...&gt;&gt;</code>. </p>

<p>The need to perform ADL for <code>__get</code> is sufficient to trigger instantiation of any and all associated classes of the type of <code>__v</code>, i.e., <code>_Variant</code>, to look for potential friend functions (and function templates) with that name defined within these classes.

Every list of <code>A</code> contains positive numbers from <code>{1, 2, ..., n}</code>. The following is an example, where <code>m = 3</code> and <code>n = 4</code>.</p>

<pre><code>A = [[1, 1, 3], [1, 2], [1, 1, 2, 4]]
</code></pre>

<p>I represent every number <code>x</code> in <code>A</code> as a pair <code>(i, j)</code> where <code>A[i][j] = x</code>. I would like to sort the numbers in <code>A</code> in non-decreasing order; breaking ties by lowest first index. That is, if <code>A[i1][j1] == A[i2][j2]</code>, then <code>(i1, j1)</code> comes before <code>(i2, j2)</code> iff <code>i1 &lt;= i2</code>.</p>

<p>In the example, I would like to return the pairs:</p>

<p>I think this approach is not good. Can we do better?</p>
","<h3><code>list.sort</code></h3>

<p>You can generate a list of indexes and then call <code>list.sort</code> with a <code>key</code>: </p>

<pre><code>B = [(i, j) for i, x in enumerate(A) for j, _ in enumerate(x)]
B.sort(key=lambda ix: A[ix[0]][ix[1]])
</code></pre>

<p></p>

<pre><code>print(B)
[(0, 0), (0, 1), (1, 0), (2, 0), (2, 1), (1, 1), (2, 2), (0, 2), (2, 3)]
</code></pre>

<p>Note that on python-2.x where iterable unpacking in functions is supported, you can simplify the <code>sort</code> call a bit:</p>

<pre><code>B.sort(key=lambda (i, j): A[i][j])
</code></pre>

<hr>

<h3><code>sorted</code></h3>

<p>This is an alternative to the version above, and generates <em>two</em> lists (one in memory which <code>sorted</code> then works on, to return another copy).</p>

<pre><code>B = sorted([
       (i, j) for i, x in enumerate(A) for j, _ in enumerate(x)
    ], 
    key=lambda ix: A[ix[0]][ix[1]]
)

print(B)
[(0, 0), (0, 1), (1, 0), (2, 0), (2, 1), (1, 1), (2, 2), (0, 2), (2, 3)]

<p>From the graph, we see that calling <code>list.sort</code> is more efficient than <code>sorted</code>. This is because <code>list.sort</code> performs an in-place sort, so there is no time/space overhead from creating a copy of the data which <code>sorted</code> has. </p>

<p>The result is the interleaved version of the two lists above.</p>

<p>I can write regular <code>for</code> loop to get this done, but I'm wondering if there's a more Pythonic way (e.g., using list comprehension or lambda) to get it done.</p>

<p>I've tried something like this:</p>

<pre><code>list(map(lambda x: x[1]+'_'+str(x[0]+1), enumerate(a)))
# this only returns ['a_1', 'b_2', 'c_3']
</code></pre>

<p>Furthermore, what changes would need to be made for the general case i.e., for 2 or more lists where <code>l2</code> is not necessarily a derivative of <code>l</code>?</p>
","<h3><a href=""https://docs.python.org/3/reference/expressions.html#yield-expressions"" rel=""noreferrer""><code>yield</code></a></h3>

<p>You can use a generator for an elegant solution. At each iteration, yield <em>twice</em>—once with the original element, and once with the element with the added suffix.</p>

<p>The generator will need to be exhausted; that can be done by tacking on a <code>list</code> call at the end.</p>

<pre><code>def transform(l):
    for i, x in enumerate(l, 1):
        yield x
        yield f'{x}_{i}'  # {}_{}'.format(x, i)
</code></pre>

<p>You can also re-write this using the <code>yield from</code> syntax for generator delegation:</p>

<pre><code>def transform(l):
    for i, x in enumerate(l, 1):
        yield from (x, f'{x}_{i}') # (x, {}_{}'.format(x, i))
</code></pre>

<p></p>

<pre><code>out_l = list(transform(l))
print(out_l)
['a', 'a_1', 'b', 'b_2', 'c', 'c_3']
</code></pre>

<p>If you're on versions older than python-3.6, replace <code>f'{x}_{i}'</code> with <code>'{}_{}'.format(x, i)</code>.</p>

<p><strong>Generalising</strong><br>
Consider a general scenario where you have N lists of the form:</p>

<pre><code>l1 = [v11, v12, ...]
l2 = [v21, v22, ...]
l3 = [v31, v32, ...]
...
</code></pre>

<p>Which you would like to interleave. These lists are not necessarily derived from each other.</p>

<p>To handle interleaving operations with these N lists, you'll need to iterate over pairs:</p>

<pre><code>def transformN(*args):
    for vals in zip(*args):
        yield from vals

out_l = transformN(l1, l2, l3, ...)
</code></pre>

<hr>

<h3>Sliced <code>list.__setitem__</code></h3>

<p>I'd recommend this from the perspective of performance. First allocate space for an empty list, and then assign list items to their appropriate positions using sliced list assignment. <code>l</code> goes into even indexes, and <code>l'</code> (<code>l</code> modified) goes into odd indexes. </p>

<pre><code>out_l = [None] * (len(l) * 2)
out_l[::2] = l
out_l[1::2] = [f'{x}_{i}' for i, x in enumerate(l, 1)]  # [{}_{}'.format(x, i) ...]
</code></pre>

<p></p>

<pre><code>print(out_l)
['a', 'a_1', 'b', 'b_2', 'c', 'c_3']
</code></pre>

<p>This is consistently the fastest from my timings (below).</p>

<p><strong>Generalising</strong><br>
To handle N lists, iteratively assign to slices. </p>

<pre><code>list_of_lists = [l1, l2, ...]

out_l = [None] * len(list_of_lists[0]) * len(list_of_lists)
for i, l in enumerate(list_of_lists):
    out_l[i::2] = l
</code></pre>

<p>A functional approach, similar to @chrisz' solution. Construct pairs using <code>zip</code> and then flatten it using <code>itertools.chain</code>.</p>

<pre><code>from itertools import chain
# [{}_{}'.format(x, i) ...]
out_l = list(chain.from_iterable(zip(l, [f'{x}_{i}' for i, x in enumerate(l, 1)]))) 
</code></pre>

<p></p>

<pre><code>print(out_l)
['a', 'a_1', 'b', 'b_2', 'c', 'c_3']
</code></pre>

<p><code>iterools.chain</code> is widely regarded as the pythonic list flattening approach.</p>

<p><strong>Generalising</strong><br>
This is the simplest solution to generalise, and I suspect the most efficient for multiple lists when N is large.</p>

out_l = list(chain.from_iterable(zip(*list_of_lists)))

However, the C standard says:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>The first operand is evaluated; there is a sequence point between its evaluation and the
  evaluation of the second or third operand (whichever is evaluated). The second operand
  is evaluated only if the first compares unequal to 0; the third operand is evaluated only if
  the first compares equal to 0; the result is the value of the second or third operand
  (whichever is evaluated), converted to the type described below.110)</p>
</blockquote>

<p>For example, the following C code</p>

<pre><code>#include &lt;stdio.h&gt;

int main() {
    int a, b;
    scanf(""%d %d"", &amp;a, &amp;b);
    int c= a &gt; b ? a + 1 : 2 + b;
    printf(""%d"", c);
    return 0;
}

<p>will generate optimized related asm code as follows:</p>

<pre><code>call    __isoc99_scanf

movl    4(%rsp), %ecx
movl    $1, %edi

cmpl    %ecx, %esi
movl    $.LC1, %esi
cmovle  %eax, %edx
xorl    %eax, %eax
call    __printf_chk
</code></pre>

<p>According to the standard, the conditional expression will only have one branch evaluated. But here both branches are evaluated, which is against the standard's semantics. Is this optimization against the C standard? Or do many compiler optimizations have something inconsistent with the language standard?</p>
","<p>The optimization is legal, due to the <a href=""https://stackoverflow.com/a/46455917/918959"">""as-if rule""</a>, i.e. <a href=""http://port70.net/~nsz/c/c11/n1570.html#5.1.2.3p6"" rel=""noreferrer"">C11 5.1.2.3p6</a>. </p>

<p>A conforming implementation is just required to produce a program that when run produces the <em>same</em> observable behaviour as the execution of the program using the abstract semantics <em>would have produced</em>. The rest of the standard just describes these <em>abstract semantics</em>.</p>

<p>What the compiled program does internally does not matter at all, the only thing that matters is that when the program ends it does not have any other observable behaviour, except reading the <code>a</code> and <code>b</code> and printing the value of <code>a + 1</code> or <code>b + 2</code> depending on which one <code>a</code> or <code>b</code>is greater, unless something occurs that causes the behaviour be undefined. (Bad input causes a, b be uninitialized and therefore accesses undefined; range error and signed overflow can occur too.) If undefined behaviour occurs, then all bets are off.</p>

<hr>

<p>Since accesses to volatile variables must be evaluated strictly according to the abstract semantics, you can get rid of the conditional move by using <code>volatile</code> here:</p>

<pre><code>#include &lt;stdio.h&gt;

int main() {
    volatile int a, b;
    scanf(""%d %d"", &amp;a, &amp;b);
    int c = a &gt; b ? a + 1 : 2 + b;

<pre><code>uint8_t MyArray[10000000];

<ul>
<li><strong>0</strong> or <strong>1</strong> for <em>95%</em> of all cases, </li>

<p>So, is there anything better than a <code>uint8_t</code> array to use for this? It should be as quick as possible to loop over the whole array in a random order, and this is very heavy on RAM bandwidth, so when having more than a few threads doing that at the same time for different arrays, currently the whole RAM bandwidth is quickly saturated.</p>

<p>I'm asking since it feels very inefficient to have such a big array (10 MB) when it's actually known that almost all values, apart from 5%, will be either 0 or 1. So when 95% of all values in the array would only actually need 1 bit instead of 8 bit, this would reduce memory usage by almost an order of magnitude. 
It feels like there has to be a more memory efficient solution that would greatly reduce RAM bandwidth required for this, and as a result also be significantly quicker for random access.</p>
","<p>This is more of a ""long comment"" than a concrete answer</p>

<p>Unless your data is something that is something well-known, I doubt anyone can DIRECTLY answer your question (and I'm not aware of anything that matches your description, but then I don't know EVERYTHING about all kinds of data patterns for all kinds of use-cases). Sparse data is a common problem in high performance computing, but it's typically ""we have a very large array, but only some values are non-zero"".</p>

<p>For not well known patterns like what I think yours is, nobody will KNOW directly which is better, and it depends on the details: how random is the random access - is the system accessing clusters of data items, or is it completely random like from a uniform random number generator. Is the table data completely random, or are there sequences of 0 then sequences of 1, with a scattering of other values? Run length encoding would work well if you have reasonably long sequences of 0 and 1, but won't work if you have ""checkerboard of 0/1"". Also, you'd have to keep a table of ""starting points"", so you can work your way to the relevant place reasonably quickly.</p>

<p>I know from a long time back that some big databases are just a large table in RAM (telephone exchange subscriber data in this example), and one of the problems there is that caches and page-table optimisations in the processor is pretty useless. The caller is so rarely the same as one recently calling someone, that there is no pre-loaded data of any kind, it's just purely random. Big page-tables is the best optimisation for that type of access.</p>

<p>In a lot of cases, compromising between ""speed and small size"" is one of those things you have to pick between in software engineering [in other engineering it's not necessarily so much of a compromise]. So, ""wasting memory for simpler code"" is quite often the preferred choice. In this sense, the ""simple"" solution is quite likely better for speed, but if you have ""better"" use for the RAM, then optimising for size of the table would give you sufficient performance and a good improvement on size. There are lots of different ways you could achieve this - as suggested in a comment, a 2 bit field where the two or three most common values are stored, and then some alternative data format for the other values - a hash-table would be my first approach, but a list or binary tree may work too - again, it depends on the patterns of where your ""not 0, 1 or 2"" are. Again, it depends on how the values are ""scattered"" in the table - are they in clusters or are they more of an evenly distributed pattern?</p>

<p>But a problem with that is that you are still reading the data from RAM. You are then spending more code processing the data, including some code to cope with the ""this is not a common value"".</p>

<p>The problem with most common compression algorithms is that they are based on unpacking sequences, so you can't random access them. And the overhead of splitting your big data into chunks of, say, 256 entries at a time, and uncompressing the 256 into a uint8_t array, fetching the data you want, and then throwing away your uncompressed data, is highly unlikely to give you good performance - assuming that's of some importance, of course.</p>

<p>In the end, you will probably have to implement one or a few of the ideas in comments/answers to test out, see if it helps solving your problem, or if memory bus is still the main limiting factor.</p>

","<p>Here's one way using <code>collections.defaultdict</code>, borrowing heavily from <a href=""https://stackoverflow.com/a/50061161/9209546"">this previous answer</a>. There are 3 steps:</p>

<ol>
<li>Create a nested <code>defaultdict</code> of <code>defaultdict</code> objects.</li>
<li>Iterate items in <code>flat</code> input dictionary.</li>
<li>Build <code>defaultdict</code> result according to the structure derived from splitting keys by <code>_</code>, using <code>getFromDict</code> to iterate the result dictionary.</li>
</ol>

<p>This is a complete example:</p>

<pre><code>from collections import defaultdict
from functools import reduce
from operator import getitem

def getFromDict(dataDict, mapList):
    """"""Iterate nested dictionary""""""
    return reduce(getitem, mapList, dataDict)

# instantiate nested defaultdict of defaultdicts
tree = lambda: defaultdict(tree)
d = tree()

# iterate input dictionary
for k, v in flat.items():
    *keys, final_key = k.split('_')
    getFromDict(d, keys)[final_key] = v

{'X': {'a': {'one': 10, 'two': 20}, 'b': {'one': 10, 'two': 20}},
 'Y': {'a': {'one': 10, 'two': 20}, 'b': {'one': 10, 'two': 20}}}
</code></pre>

<p>As a final step, you can convert your <code>defaultdict</code> to a regular <code>dict</code>, though usually this step is not necessary.</p>

<pre><code>def default_to_regular_dict(d):
    """"""Convert nested defaultdict to regular dict of dicts.""""""
    if isinstance(d, defaultdict):
        d = {k: default_to_regular_dict(v) for k, v in d.items()}
    return d

# convert back to regular dict
res = default_to_regular_dict(d)

<p>In some (rare) cases the language offers multiple division operators. For instance, in Haskell we have <code>div,mod</code> satisfying only (1) and (2), similarly to Python, and we also have <code>quot,rem</code> satisfying only (1) and (3). The latter pair of operators rounds division <em>towards zero</em>, at the price of returning negative remainders, e.g., we have <code>(-1) `quot` 2 = 0</code> and <code>(-1) `rem` 2 = (-1)</code>.</p>

<p>C# also gives up (2), and allows <code>%</code> to return a negative remainder. Coherently, integer division rounds towards zero. Java, Scala, Pascal, and C, starting from C99, also adopt this strategy.</p>

In my example I have a class <code>Sample&lt;T&gt;</code> and an implicit conversion operator from <code>T</code> to <code>Sample&lt;T&gt;</code>. </p>

<pre><code>private class Sample&lt;T&gt;
{
   public readonly T Value;

<pre><code>{
   int? a = 3;
   Sample&lt;int&gt; sampleA = a;
}
</code></pre>

<p><strong>Here is the key part:</strong><br>
In my opinion this should not compile because <code>Sample&lt;int&gt;</code> defines a conversion from <code>int</code> to <code>Sample&lt;int&gt;</code> but not from <code>int?</code> to <code>Sample&lt;int&gt;</code>. <strong>But it compiles and runs successfully!</strong> (By which I mean the conversion operator is invoked and <code>3</code> will be assigned to the <code>readonly</code> field.)</p>

<p>And it gets even worse. Here the conversion operator isn't invoked and <code>sampleB</code> will be set to <code>null</code>:</p>

<pre><code>{
   int? b = null;
   Sample&lt;int&gt; sampleB = b;
}
</code></pre>

<p>A great answer would probably be split into two parts:</p>

<ol>
<li>Why does the code in the first snippet compile?</li>
<li>Can I prevent the code from compiling in this scenario?</li>
</ol>
","<p>I think it's lifted conversion operator in action. Specification says that:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Given a user-defined conversion operator that converts from a
  non-nullable value type S to a non-nullable value type T, a lifted
  conversion operator exists that converts from S? to T?. This lifted
  conversion operator performs an unwrapping from S? to S followed by
  the user-defined conversion from S to T followed by a wrapping from T
  to T?, except that a null valued S? converts directly to a null valued
  T?.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>It looks like it's not applicable here, because while type <code>S</code> is value type here (<code>int</code>), type <code>T</code> is not value type (<code>Sample</code> class). However <a href=""https://github.com/dotnet/roslyn/issues/4555"" rel=""noreferrer"">this issue</a> in Roslyn repository states that it's actually a bug in specification. And Roslyn <a href=""https://github.com/gafter/roslyn/blob/e43b45175c99cfe2391c7c939cae873637117cff/src/Compilers/CSharp/Portable/Binder/Semantics/Conversions/UserDefinedImplicitConversions.cs"" rel=""noreferrer"">code</a> documentation confirms this:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>As mentioned above, here we diverge from the specification, in two
  ways. First, we only check for the lifted form if the normal form was
  inapplicable. Second, we are supposed to apply lifting semantics only
  if the conversion  parameter and return types are <em>both</em> non-nullable
  value types.</p>
  
  <p>In fact the native compiler determines whether to check for a lifted
  form on the basis of:</p>
  
  <ul>
  <li>Is the type we are ultimately converting from a nullable value type?</li>
  <li>Is the parameter type of the conversion a non-nullable value type?</li>
  <li>Is the type we are ultimately converting to a nullable value type, pointer type, or reference type?</li>
  </ul>
  
  <p>If the answer to all those questions is ""yes"" then we lift to nullable
  and see if the resulting operator is applicable.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>If compiler would follow specification - it would produce a error in this case as you expect (and in some older versions it did), but now it does not.</p>

<p>So to summarize: I think compiler uses lifted form of your implicit operator, which should be impossible according to specification, but compiler diverges from specification here, because:</p>

<ul>
<li>It is considered bug in specification, not in compiler.</li>
<li>Specification was already violated by old, pre-roslyn compiler, and it's good to maintain backwards compatibility.</li>
</ul>

<p>As described in first quote describing how lifted operator works (with addition that we allow <code>T</code> to be reference type) - you may note it describes exactly what happens in your case. <code>null</code> valued <code>S</code> (<code>int?</code>) is assigned directly to <code>T</code> (<code>Sample</code>) without conversion operator, and non-null is unwrapped to <code>int</code> and run through your operator (wrapping to <code>T?</code> is obviously not needed if <code>T</code> is reference type).</p>

<p>Your situation is analogous: though your error result <code>x</code> probably doesn't actually have any <code>a</code> values inside, its type is still tagged with <code>a</code>.

<p>Just using some demonstration classes because the question does not really give much to go on.</p>

<h1>Setup</h1>

<p>Basically we have two collections here, being </p>

<p><strong>entities</strong></p>

<pre><code>{ ""_id"" : ObjectId(""5b08ceb40a8a7614c70a5710""), ""name"" : ""A"" }
{ ""_id"" : ObjectId(""5b08ceb40a8a7614c70a5711""), ""name"" : ""B"" }
</code></pre>

<p>and <strong>others</strong></p>

<pre><code>{
        ""_id"" : ObjectId(""5b08cef10a8a7614c70a5712""),
        ""entity"" : ObjectId(""5b08ceb40a8a7614c70a5710""),
        ""name"" : ""Sub-A""
}
{
        ""_id"" : ObjectId(""5b08cefd0a8a7614c70a5713""),
        ""entity"" : ObjectId(""5b08ceb40a8a7614c70a5711""),
        ""name"" : ""Sub-B""
}
</code></pre>

<p>And a couple of classes to bind them to, just as very basic examples:</p>

<pre><code>public class Entity
{
  public ObjectId id;
  public string name { get; set; }
}

public class Other
{
  public ObjectId id;
  public ObjectId entity { get; set; }
  public string name { get; set; }
}

public class EntityWithOthers
{
  public ObjectId id;
  public string name { get; set; }
  public IEnumerable&lt;Other&gt; others;
}

 public class EntityWithOther
{
  public ObjectId id;
  public string name { get; set; }
  public Other others;
}

<p>Probably the easiest to understand since the fluent interface is basically the same as the general BSON structure. The <a href=""https://docs.mongodb.com/manual/reference/operator/aggregation/lookup/"" rel=""noreferrer""><code>$lookup</code></a> stage has all the same arguments and the <a href=""https://docs.mongodb.com/manual/reference/operator/aggregation/arrayElemAt/"" rel=""noreferrer""><code>$arrayElemAt</code></a> is represented with <code>First()</code>. For the <a href=""https://docs.mongodb.com/manual/reference/operator/aggregation/sort/"" rel=""noreferrer""><code>$sort</code></a> you can simply supply a BSON document or other valid expression.</p>

<p>An alternate is the newer expressive form of <a href=""https://docs.mongodb.com/manual/reference/operator/aggregation/lookup/"" rel=""noreferrer""><code>$lookup</code></a> with a sub-pipeline statement for MongoDB 3.6 and above.</p>

<p>Aside from other uses, a primary task of a ""sub-pipeline"" is to reduce the documents returned in the target array of <a href=""https://docs.mongodb.com/manual/reference/operator/aggregation/lookup/"" rel=""noreferrer""><code>$lookup</code></a>. Also the <a href=""https://docs.mongodb.com/manual/reference/operator/aggregation/unwind/"" rel=""noreferrer""><code>$unwind</code></a> here serves a purpose of actually <a href=""https://docs.mongodb.com/manual/core/aggregation-pipeline-optimization/#lookup-unwind-coalescence"" rel=""noreferrer"">being ""merged""</a> into the <a href=""https://docs.mongodb.com/manual/reference/operator/aggregation/lookup/"" rel=""noreferrer""><code>$lookup</code></a> statement on server execution, so this is typically more efficient than just grabbing the first element of the resulting array.</p>

If not for that, this is actually better than the <a href=""https://docs.mongodb.com/manual/reference/operator/aggregation/arrayElemAt/"" rel=""noreferrer""><code>$arrayElemAt</code></a> when you know you have ""one"" related result. If you want the <a href=""https://docs.mongodb.com/manual/reference/operator/aggregation/unwind/"" rel=""noreferrer""><code>$unwind</code></a> ""coalescence"", then you are better off using the fluent interface, or a different form as demonstrated later.</p>

<h1>Summary</h1>

<p>So there are quite a few ways to essentially arrive at what is basically the same query statement with exactly the same results. Whilst you ""could"" parse the JSON to <code>BsonDocument</code> form and feed this to the fluent <code>Aggregate()</code> command, it's generally better to use the natural builders or the LINQ interfaces as they do easily map onto the same statement.</p>

<p>The options with <a href=""https://docs.mongodb.com/manual/reference/operator/aggregation/unwind/"" rel=""noreferrer""><code>$unwind</code></a> are largely shown because even with a ""singular"" match that ""coalescence"" form is actually far more optimal then using <a href=""https://docs.mongodb.com/manual/reference/operator/aggregation/arrayElemAt/"" rel=""noreferrer""><code>$arrayElemAt</code></a> to take the ""first"" array element. This even becomes more important with considerations of things like the BSON Limit where the <a href=""https://docs.mongodb.com/manual/reference/operator/aggregation/lookup/"" rel=""noreferrer""><code>$lookup</code></a> target array could cause the parent document to exceed 16MB without further filtering. There is another post here on <a href=""https://stackoverflow.com/a/45726501/2313887"">Aggregate $lookup Total size of documents in matching pipeline exceeds maximum document size</a> where I actually discuss how to avoid that limit being hit by using such options or other <code>Lookup()</code> syntax available to the fluent interface only at this time.</p>

<p>For example, let's say there are 5 states: PreActivation (Created but not started; i.e. an enemy in a future wave), Active (Currently in use; i.e. an enemy on the screen, attacking you), Paused (No longer active, but may reactivate; i.e. an enemy if the player uses a time-freezing power), DeActivated (An object whose finished use but is still in the game world; i.e. an enemy whose body is left after death like in Doom 1 &amp; 2), and ToRemove (An object slated for removal from the game; i.e. an enemy after you clear a level and move to the next one).</p>

<p>What I want to do is define the enum so the states hold all applicable flags; for instance, a DeActivated enemy: 1. Has been previously activated, and 2. Isn't currently active. My current thinking is doing something like this:</p>

<pre><code>public enum ObjectState
{
    // The first section are the flags
    BeenActivated   = 0b0000001, // Previously activated
    CurrentlyActive = 0b0000010, // Currently activated
    IsSuspended     = 0b0000100, // It may be reactivated
    ShouldRemove    = 0b0001000, // It should be removed
    // These are the states
    PreActivation   = 0b0000100, // Mot currently active, nor has it ever been active, but it will get activated
    Active          = 0b0000011, // Currently active,     and it's been active
    Paused          = 0b0000101, // Not currently active, but it's been active before
    DeActivated     = 0b0000001, // Not currently active, but it's been active before, and it shouldn't get reactivated, but don't remove yet
    ToRemove        = 0b0001001  // Not currently active, but it's been active before, and it shouldn't get reactivated, it should be removed
}
</code></pre>

<p>As far as I know, this should work correctly, but I have a few main concerns:</p>

<ol>
<li>Are there any problems likely to come from this?</li>
<li>Is this bad practice?</li>
<li>Is this bad practice? And, if it is;

<ul>
<li>A. What's wrong with it?</li>
<li>B. What should I do instead? I'd just make the object's state a collection of these flags, but I'd like a shorthand enum for specific states, as this allows for complexity for specific instances and simplicity when it's needed. Is there a more acceptable way to achieve this?</li>
</ul></li>
</ol>

<p>Sorry if this is a repeat or I broke some other rule, but I just created an account today; this is my 1st post. Plus, I'm not sure what you would call this when searching, and I didn't get any similar hits from here or Google.</p>
","<p>You can do so. It's the very point of flag enums. If an <code>enum</code> is intended to work as flags, mark it with the <code>[Flags]</code> attribute.</p>

<p>I would suggest to combine the existing flags with a bitwise or (<code>|</code>) instead. It's more readable and less error-prone.</p>

<pre><code>[Flags]
public enum ObjectState
{
    // Flags
    BeenActivated   = 0b0000001, // Previously activated
    CurrentlyActive = 0b0000010, // Currently activated
    IsSuspended     = 0b0000100, // It may be reactivated
    ShouldRemove    = 0b0001000, // It should be removed

    // States as combination of flags.
    PreActivationState   = IsSuspended,                     // Mot currently active, nor has it ever been active, but it will get activated
    ActiveState          = BeenActivated | CurrentlyActive, // Currently active,     and it's been active
    PausedState          = BeenActivated | IsSuspended,     // Not currently active, but it's been active before
    DeActivatedState     = BeenActivated,                   // Not currently active, but it's been active before, and it shouldn't get reactivated, but don't remove yet
    ToRemoveState        = BeenActivated | ShouldRemove     // Not currently active, but it's been active before, and it shouldn't get reactivated, it should be removed
}
</code></pre>

<p>I also added a ""State"" suffix to the states to better differentiate them from flags. Or turn it around and add a ""Flags"" suffix to the flags instead.</p>

<p>No. <code>[&amp;counter](){counter++;}</code> is a lambda expression and per <a href=""http://eel.is/c++draft/expr.prim.lambda#closure-1.sentence-1"" rel=""noreferrer"">[expr.prim.lambda.closure]/1</a>:</p>

  <p>The type of a lambda-expression (which is also the type of the closure object) is a unique, unnamed non-union class type, called the closure type, whose properties are described below.</p>

<p>So, for each lambda expression, even if it is identical to a previous one, you will get a unique type.</p>

<pre><code>use strict;
use warnings;

my $choice = 0;

while ($choice == 0){

    #This is not numeric
    $choice = '5,6,7';

    if ($choice eq '-4'){

<p>When you run this, you will get the warning message <code>Argument ""5,6,7"" isn't numeric in numeric eq (==) at example.pl line 11</code>. But line 11 corresponds to the line <code>if ($choice eq '-4'){</code> which cannot possibly cause this warning message because it does not contain a numeric comparison.</p>

<p>It seems what's <em>actually</em> happening is that Perl advances to the next comparison, <code>while ($choice == 0){</code>, but the line counter used for the warning message does not advance.</p>

<p>What makes this particular case worse is that, since the ""bad"" comparison is the loop condition, it is actually far away from the provided line. In my (pre-simplification) script, it was hundreds of lines away from the provided line number.</p>

<p>Is this a bug or just an unfortunate limitation of the parser?</p>

<p>So far, I have it half-way working. The problem is that it doesn't calculate the non-client area up front, unless I make a minor tweak, such as re-sizing it. </p>

<p>I've followed many resources describing how to accomplish this. My implementation of handling <code>WM_NCCALCSIZE</code> is more or less identical to ""working"" examples I've found.

When I drop a breakpoint inside the message handler of mine (<code>WMNCCalcSize</code>), based on the examples I've found, I'm supposed to first check <code>Msg.CalcValidRects</code>, and only do my calculation if it's <code>True</code>. But when debugging run-time, it's <code>False</code>, thus the calculation isn't done.</p>

<p>In design-time, if I re-size the control, THEN it decides to calculate properly. It's still not perfect (this code is still in the works), but it doesn't seem to set the non-client area until after I tweak it. Further, in run-time, if I tweak the size in the code, it still doesn't calculate. </p>

<p>The image on the top is when the form is initially created/shown. The second one is after I re-size it a little bit. Notice the test button, which is aligned <code>alLeft</code>. So initially, it consumes the area which is supposed to be non-client.</p>

<p>If I comment out the check <code>if Msg.CalcValidRects then begin</code>, then it calculates properly. But I see every example doing this check, and I'm pretty sure it's needed.</p>

<p>What am I doing wrong and how to make it calculate the non-client area at all times?</p>

<p>You've got that wrong. The message has a somewhat complicated mechanism and the <a href=""https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/ms632634(v=vs.85).aspx"" rel=""noreferrer"">documentation</a> might be slightly confusing trying to explain two distinct mode the message operates (<code>wParam</code> true or false). The part that relates to your case is the second paragraph of <code>lParam</code>:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>If wParam is <strong>FALSE</strong>, lParam points to a <strong>RECT</strong> structure. On entry, the
  structure contains the proposed window rectangle for the window. On
  exit, the structure should contain the screen coordinates of the
  corresponding window client area.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>You'll find numerous usage examples of this simple form in the VCL where <code>wParam</code> is not checked at all, like in <code>TToolWindow.WMNCCalcSize</code>, <code>TCustomCategoryPanel.WMNCCalcSize</code> etc..</p>

<p>(Note that <code>NCCALCSIZE_PARAMS.rgrc</code> is not even a rectangle array when <code>wParam</code> is false, but since you're operating on the supposed <em>first</em> rectangle, you're fine.)</p>

<p>This seems inefficient to me because I have to execute an <code>if</code> every time the function is called event though the correct branch should be known at compile time. I could fix this with template specialization:</p>

<p>This way I don't have any conditionals executed in runtime. This solution is a bit more complicated (especially since in my real code the class has several template arguments and you can't partially specialize functions so I will need to wrap the function in a class).</p>

<p>My question is, is the compiler smart enough to know not to execute the conditional in option 1 since it always executes the same way or do I need to write the specializations? If the compiler is smart enough I would be happy to know if this is compiler dependent or a language feature that I can rely on?</p>
","<p>The compiler will probably optimize the branch away since it is known at compile time what <code>b</code> is. This is not guaranteed though and the only way to know for sure is to check the assembly.  </p>

<p>I wonder how to achieve the same behavior efficiently not using <code>goto</code>.

So this is the most efficient way of doing this I can think of.</p>

<p>Thank you</p>
","<p>In this case you <strong>don't</strong> wan't to avoid using <code>goto</code>.</p>

<p><em>In general</em> the use of <code>goto</code> should be avoided, however there are exceptions to this rule, and your case is a good example of one of them.</p>

<p>Let's look at the alternatives:</p>

<pre><code>for (i = 0; i &lt; N; ++i) {
    for (j = 0; j &lt; N; j++) {
        for (k = 0; k &lt; N; ++k) {
            ...
            if (condition)
                break;
            ...
        }
        if (condition)
            break;
    }
    if (condition)
        break;
}
</code></pre>

<p>Or:</p>

<pre><code>int flag = 0
for (i = 0; (i &lt; N) &amp;&amp; !flag; ++i) {
    for (j = 0; (j &lt; N) &amp;&amp; !flag; j++) {
        for (k = 0; (k &lt; N) &amp;&amp; !flag; ++k) {
            ...
            if (condition) {
                flag = 1
                break;
            ...
        }
    }
}
</code></pre>

<p>Neither of these is as concise or as readable as the <code>goto</code> version.</p>

<p>Using a <code>goto</code> is considered acceptable in cases where you're only jumping ahead (not backward) and doing so makes your code more readable and understandable.</p>

<p>If on the other hand you use <code>goto</code> to jump in both directions, or to jump into a scope which could potentially bypass variable initialization, <em>that</em> would be bad.</p>

<p>Here's a bad example of <code>goto</code>:</p>

<pre><code>int x;
scanf(""%d"", &amp;x);
if (x==4) goto bad_jump;

{
    int y=9;

// jumping here skips the initialization of y
bad_jump:

    printf(""y=%d\n"", y);
}
</code></pre>

<p>A C++ compiler will throw an error here because the <code>goto</code> jumps over the initialization of <code>y</code>.  C compilers however will compile this, and the above code will invoke <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Undefined_behavior"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">undefined behavior</a> when attempting to print <code>y</code> which will be uninitialized if the <code>goto</code> occurs.</p>

<p>Another example of proper use of <code>goto</code> is in error handling:</p>

<pre><code>void f()
{
    char *p1 = malloc(10);
    if (!p1) {
        goto end1;
    }
    char *p2 = malloc(10);
    if (!p2) {
        goto end2;
    }
    char *p3 = malloc(10);
    if (!p3) {
        goto end3;
    }
    // do something with p1, p2, and p3

end3:
    free(p3);
end2:
    free(p2);
end1:
    free(p1);
}
</code></pre>

<p>This performs all of the cleanup at the end of the function.  Compare this to the alternative:</p>

<pre><code>void f()
{
    char *p1 = malloc(10);
    if (!p1) {
        return;
    }
    char *p2 = malloc(10);
    if (!p2) {
        free(p1);
        return;
    }
    char *p3 = malloc(10);
    if (!p3) {
        free(p2);
        free(p1);
        return;
    }
    // do something with p1, p2, and p3

    free(p3);
    free(p2);
    free(p1);
}
</code></pre>

<p>Where the cleanup is done in multiple places.  If you later add more resources that need to be cleaned up, you have to remember to add the cleanup in all of these places plus the cleanup of any resources that were obtained earlier.</p>

<p>The above example is more relevant to C than C++ since in the latter case you can use classes with proper destructors and smart pointers to avoid manual cleanup.</p>

<p><strong>Me, before</strong></p>

<p>In my former life I was, chronologically, a university prof, a government policy advisor, an independent consultant, and a software developer.  The last of these was the result of an idea I had in 1992 for a remote computer backup system.  The concept was to transfer each distinct file but once, even if the file was owned by multiple users (as was the case for program files, which at the time accounted for the lion's share of the occupied space on users' hard drives). This resulted in it being highly economic to perform automatic nightly backups with the technology available at the time (14400 bps modems). I hired three young coders and we set about writing a DOS app in C. After some ups and downs I licensed the software to a company that moved it from DOS to Windows and then to the internet.  A few years later they were acquired (for their one and only product--the remote backup software) by a US software giant.</p>

<p>There are several libraries that I know of outside of the stl that are supposed to handle unicode-</p>

<p>There are a few features of the stl (<a href=""https://stackoverflow.com/questions/27225196/is-wstring-character-is-unicode-what-happens-during-conversion"">wstring</a>,<a href=""http://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/locale/codecvt_utf8"" rel=""noreferrer"">codecvt_utf8</a>) that were included but people seem to be ambivalent about using because they deal with UTF-16 which this site: (<a href=""https://utf8everywhere.org/"" rel=""noreferrer"">utf-8 everywhere</a>) says shouldn't be used and many people online seem agree with the premise.</p>

<p>The only thing I'm looking for is the ability to do 4 things with a unicode strings-</p>

<ol>
<li>Read a string into memory</li>
<li>Search the string with regex using unicode or ascii, concatenate or do text replacement/formatting with it with either ascii+unicode numbers or characters.</li>

<li>Write a string to disk or send wherever.</li>

<p>Thank you for your time.</p>
","<p>I will try to throw some ideas here:</p>

<ul>
<li>most C++ programs/programmers just assume that a text is an almost opaque sequence of bytes. UTF-8 is probably guilty for that, and there is no surprise that many comments resume to: <em>don't worry with Unicode, just process UTF-8 encoded strings</em></li>
<li>files only contains bytes. At a moment, if you try to internally process true Unicode code points, you will have to serialize that to bytes -> here again UTF-8 wins the point</li>
<li><p>as soon as you go out of the Basic Multilingual Plane (16 bits code points), things become more and more complex. The <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Emoji"" rel=""noreferrer"">emoji</a> is specifically awful to process: an emoji can be followed by a <em>variation selector</em> (U+FE0E VARIATION SELECTOR-15 (VS15) for text or U+FE0F VARIATION SELECTOR-16 (VS16) for emoji-style) to alter its display style, more or less the old <code>i bs ^</code> that was used in 1970 ascii when one wanted to print <code>î</code>. That's not all, the characters  U+1F3FB to U+1F3FF are use to provide a skin color for 102 human emoji spread across six blocks: Dingbats, Emoticons, Miscellaneous Symbols, Miscellaneous Symbols and Pictographs, Supplemental Symbols and Pictographs, and Transport and Map Symbols.</p>

<p>That simply means that up to 3 consecutive unicode code points can represent one single glyph... So the idea that one character is one <code>char32_t</code> is still an approximation</p></li>
</ul>

<p>My conclusion is that Unicode <strong>is</strong> a complex thing, and really requires a dedicated library like ICU. You can try to use simple tools like the converters of the standard library when you only deal with the BMP, but full support is far beyond that.</p>

<hr>

<p>BTW: even other languages like Python that pretend to have a native unicode support (which is IMHO far better than current C++ one) ofter fails on some part:</p>

<ul>
<li>the tkinter GUI library cannot display any code point outside the BMP - while it is the standard IDLE Python tool</li>
<li>different modules or the standard library are dedicated to Unicode in addition to the core language support (codecs and unicodedata), and other modules are available in the Python Package Index like the emoji support because the standard library does not meet all needs</li>
</ul>

<p>So support for Unicode is poor for more than 10 years, and I do not really hope that things will go much better in the next 10 years...</p>

<p>UPDATE It appears that the choice of system call has changed between Java 8 and 10. This can be seen by prepending <code>strace -f</code> to the start of the command line</p>

<p>In Java 8, the following calls are repeated in the inner loop</p>

<pre><code>[pid 49027] ftruncate(23, 53248)        = 0
[pid 49027] lseek(23, 0, SEEK_SET)      = 0
[pid 49027] lseek(23, 0, SEEK_CUR)      = 0
</code></pre>

<p>In Java 10, the following calls are repeated</p>

<pre><code>[pid   444] fstat(8, {st_mode=S_IFREG|0664, st_size=126976, ...}) = 0
[pid   444] fallocate(8, 0, 0, 131072)  = 0
[pid   444] lseek(8, 0, SEEK_SET)       = 0
[pid   444] lseek(8, 0, SEEK_CUR)       = 0
</code></pre>

<p>In particular, <code>fallocate</code> does a lot more work than <code>ftruncate</code> and the time taken appears to be proportional to the length of the file, not the length added to the file.</p>

<p>One work around is to;</p>

<ul>
<li>use reflection to the <code>fd</code> file descriptor</li>
<li>use JNA or FFI to call ftruncate.</li>
</ul>

<p>This seems like a hacky solution.  Is there a better alternative in Java 10?</p>

<p>You can use kernel-aware Java profiler like <a href=""https://github.com/jvm-profiling-tools/async-profiler"" rel=""noreferrer"">async-profiler</a>.</p>

<p>Here is what it shows for JDK 8:</p>

<p><a href=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/jJ87P.png"" rel=""noreferrer""><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/jJ87P.png"" alt=""JDK 8 profile for RandomAccessFile.setLength""></a></p>

<p>and for JDK 10:</p>

<p><a href=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/JOcus.png"" rel=""noreferrer""><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/JOcus.png"" alt=""JDK 10 profile for RandomAccessFile.setLength""></a></p>

<p>The profiles confirm your conclusion that <code>RandomAccessFile.setLength</code> uses <code>ftruncate</code> syscall on JDK 8, but a much heavier <code>fallocate</code> on JDK 10.</p>

<p><code>ftruncate</code> is really fast, because it only updates file metadata, while <code>fallocate</code> indeed allocates disk space (or physical memory in case of <code>tmpfs</code>).</p>

<p>This change was made in attempt to fix <a href=""https://bugs.openjdk.java.net/browse/JDK-8168628"" rel=""noreferrer"">JDK-8168628</a>: SIGBUS when extending file size to map it. But later it was realized that this is a bad idea, and the fix was reverted in JDK 11: <a href=""https://bugs.openjdk.java.net/browse/JDK-8202261"" rel=""noreferrer"">JDK-8202261</a>.</p>

<p>There is an internal class <code>sun.nio.ch.FileDispatcherImpl</code> which has static <code>truncate0</code> method. It uses <code>ftruncate</code> syscall under the hood. You can call it via Reflection, having in mind that this is a private unsupported API.</p>

<p>Everyone knows that example 1 is a Very Bad Thing, and clearly invokes undefined behavior. Example 2 has no problems. My question is regarding example 3. Does the comma operator work like a semicolon in this kind of expression? Are 2 and 3 equivalent or is 3 just as undefined as 1?</p>

<p>Specifically I was considering this regarding something like <code>free(foo), foo = bar</code>. This is basically the same problem as above. Can I be sure that foo is freed before it's reassigned, or is this a clear sequence point problem?</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><em>2</em> The  left  operand  of  a  comma  operator  is  evaluated  as  a  void  expression;  <strong>there  is  a sequence  point  between  its 
  evaluation  and  that  of  the  right  operand.</strong>   Then  the  right
  operand is evaluated; the result has its type and value</p>

<p>Section 5.14 p1 of the <a href=""http://www.open-std.org/jtc1/sc22/wg21/docs/papers/2012/n3337.pdf"" rel=""noreferrer"">C++11 standard</a> has similar language:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>A pair of expressions separated by a comma is evaluated left-to-right;
  the left expression is a discarded- value expression.
  <strong>Every value computation and side effect associated with the left
  expression is sequenced before every value computation and side effect
  associated with the right expression.</strong> The type and value of the result
  are the type and value of the right operand; the result is of the same
  value category as its right operand, and is a bit-field if its right
  operand is a glvalue and a bit-field.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Because of the sequence point, <code>a = b + a</code> is guaranteed to be fully evaluated before <code>a++</code> in the expression <code>a = b + a, a++</code>.</p>

<p>Regarding <code>free(foo), foo = bar</code>, this also guarantees that <code>foo</code> is free'ed before a new value is assigned.</p>

<p>I was only able to reproduce this on a Windows build of Python - to be precise: <code>Python 2.7.15 (v2.7.15:ca079a3ea3, Apr 30 2018, 16:30:26) [MSC v.1500 64 bit (AMD64)] on win32</code>. On my <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arch_Linux"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Arch Linux</a> box installation of Python (<code>Python 2.7.15 (default, May 1 2018, 20:16:04) [GCC 7.3.1 20180406] on linux2</code>) the loop does not seem to terminate indicating that the <code>a**2 = a * a</code> invariant holds there.</p>

<p>What is going on here? I know that IEEE floats come with a plethora of misconceptions and idiosyncrasies (<a href=""https://stackoverflow.com/questions/588004/is-floating-point-math-broken"">this</a>, for example, does not answer my question), but I fail to see what part of the specification or what kind of implementation of <code>**</code> could possibly allow for this.</p>

<p>To address the duplicate flagging: This is most likely not directly an IEEE floating point math problem and more of a implementation issue of the <code>**</code> operator. Therefore, this is not a duplicate of questions which are only asking about floating point issues such as precision or associativity.</p>
","<p>Python relies on the underlying platform for its floating-point arithmetic. I hypothesize that Python’s <code>**</code> operator uses a <code>pow</code> implementation (as used in C) (confirmed by <a href=""https://stackoverflow.com/users/2357112/user2357112"">user2357112</a> referring to Python <a href=""https://github.com/python/cpython/blob/v2.7.15/Objects/floatobject.c#L921"" rel=""noreferrer"">2.7.15 source code</a>).</p>

<p>Generally, <code>pow</code> is implemented by using (approximations of) logarithms and exponentials, in part. This is necessary since <code>pow</code> supports non-integer arguments. (Of course, this general implementation does not preclude specializations for subsets of its domain.)</p>

<p>Microsoft’s <code>pow</code> implementation is notoriously not good. Hence, for <code>pow(a, 2)</code>, it may be returning a result not equal to <code>a*a</code>.</p>

</p>
","<p>Simply because in both cases the combination of colors is not the same due to how opacity of the the <strong>top</strong> layer affect the color of the <strong>bottom</strong> layer.</p>

<p>For the first case, you see <strong>50% of blue</strong> and 50% of transparent in the top layer. Through the transparent part, you see 50% of red color in the bottom layer (so we only see <strong>25% of red</strong> in total). Same logic for the second case (<strong>50% of red</strong> and <strong>25% of blue</strong>); thus you will see different colors because for both cases we don't have the same proportion. </p>

<p>To avoid this you need to have the same proportion for both your colors.</p>

<p>Here is an example to better illustrate and show how we can obtain same color:</p>

<p>In the top layer (the inner span) we have <code>0.25</code> of opacity (so we have 25% of the first color and 75% of transparent) then for the bottom layer (the outer span) we have <code>0.333</code> opacity (so we have 1/3 of 75% = 25% of the color and the remaining is transparent). We have the same proportion in both layers (25%) so we see the <strong>same color</strong> even if we reverse the order of layers.</p>

<p><div class=""snippet"" data-lang=""js"" data-hide=""false"" data-console=""true"" data-babel=""false"">
<div class=""snippet-code"">
<pre class=""snippet-code-css lang-css prettyprint-override""><code>.a {

</div>
</p>

<p>As a side note, the white background is also affecting the rendering of the colors. Its proportion is 50% which will make the logical result of 100% (25% + 25% + 50%).</p>

<p>You may also notice that it won't be possible to have same proportion for our both colors if the top layer is having an opacity bigger than <code>0.5</code> because the <strong>first one will have more than 50%</strong> and it will remain less than 50% for the second one:</p>

</div>
</div>
</p>

<p>The common trivial case is when the top layer is having <code>opacity:1</code> which make the top color with a proportion of 100%; thus it's an <strong>opaque</strong> color.</p>

<hr>

<p>For a more accurate and precise explanation here is the formula used to calculate the color we see after the combination of both layers<sup><a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alpha_compositing"" rel=""noreferrer"">ref</a></sup>:</p>

<pre><code>ColorF = (ColorT*opacityT + ColorB*OpacityB*(1 - OpacityT)) / factor
</code></pre>

<p><strong>ColorF</strong> is our final color. <strong>ColorT</strong>/<strong>ColorB</strong> are respectively the top and bottom colors.  <strong>opacityT</strong>/<strong>opacityB</strong> are respectively the top and bottom opacities defined for each color:</p>

<p>The <code>factor</code> is defined by this formula <code>OpacityT + OpacityB*(1 - OpacityT)</code>.</p>

<p>It's clear that if we switch the two layers the <code>factor</code> won't change (it will remain a constant) but we can clearly see that the proportion for each color will change since we don't have the same multiplier.</p>

<p>For our initial case, both opacities are <code>0.5</code> so we will have:</p>

<pre><code>ColorF = (ColorT*0.5 + ColorB*0.5*(1 - 0.5)) / factor
</code></pre>

<p>Like explained above, the top color is having a proportion of 50% (<code>0.5</code>) and the bottom one is having a proportion of 25% (<code>0.5*(1-0.5)</code>) so switching the layers will also switch these proportions; thus we see a different <em>final</em> color.</p>

<p>Now if we consider the second example we will have:</p>

<pre><code>ColorF = (ColorT*0.25 + ColorB*0.333*(1 - 0.25)) / factor
</code></pre>

<p>In this case we have <code>0.25 = 0.333*(1 - 0.25)</code> so switching the two layers will have no effect; thus the color will remain the same.</p>

<p>We can also clearly identify the trivial cases:</p>

<ul>
<li>When top layer is having <code>opacity:0</code> the formula is equal to <code>ColorF = ColorB</code></li>
<li>When top layer is having <code>opacity:1</code> the formula is equal to <code>ColorF = ColorT</code></li>
</ul>

<p>So I was wondering if there is a way to see the size of the compiled code of a subroutine in a Module of Excel 2016?</p>

<p>My attempts so far have been limited to searching online for methods to determine the size of a compiled module or subroutine in VBA.</p>

<p>It led me to the limits of VBA as listed in <a href=""https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/previous-versions/visualstudio/visual-basic-6/aa240819(v=vs.60)"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">here</a>. It does not mention a way to see the size of the procedure compiled, nor does it mention whether that is (practically) possible.</p>

<p>(As was mentioned in the comments, the current maximum size of the compiled procedure is 64K as stated <a href=""https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/vba/language-reference-vba/articles/procedure-too-large"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">here</a>.)</p>

<ol>
<li>I think the compiled procedure size is not 1 on 1 related to the number of lines. (Because that does not take into account short or long lines. But I am currently unsure about how the vba-procure is compiled, and consequently how lines contribute to the compiled file size, otherwise a solution could possibly be to compute the compiled file size.)</li>
<li>Nor is the procedure 1 on 1 dependent on the size of the code as stored as a '.txt' file. (because it can contain comments which do not contribute to the compiled code size)</li>

<p><strong>Disclamer</strong> - I am well aware of the shortcomings of the old code I am modifying. That it is poorly written, I think this quote of Bill Gates illustrates it quite well:</p>

  <p>Measuring programming progress by lines of code is like measuring
  aircraft building progress by weight.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I think refactoring, and breaking the code up in shorter subroutines is an appropriate first step. To monitor this process, in combination with the hard bottleneck presented by VBA as the <code>Procedure too long</code>- error led me to this question.</p>
","<p>No, you can't do that. VBA is compiled in several stages, it's part p-code, part interpreted, and at the end of the day the size in kb of the compiled procedure isn't what you need to work on.</p>

<hr>

<p>You need to read about <strong>Abstraction</strong>, urgently. A procedure that triggers this compiler error is over 10K lines of code. A healthy procedure at the appropriate abstraction level might be somewhere between 500 and a thousand times smaller than that (not kidding) - <strong>the size of the compiled code is absolutely meaningless</strong>.</p>

<p>If you're worrying about the size of the compiled code, you're not writing the code for a human.</p>

<p>Code isn't written for a compiler to crunch and a runtime environment to run. Code is written for a human maintainer to read, understand, follow, debug, modify, extend, etc. Without any level of abstraction, code is a boring, excruciatingly mind-numbing series of executable statements that are invariably redundant, inefficient, and annoyingly bug-prone.</p>

<p>There are 3rd-party tools you can use to analyze VBA code. MZ-Tools 3.0 was free, but the latest version isn't. It has a feature that can tell you how many lines of code are in each procedure of each module, how much of it is commented-out, whether you have unused variables, etc.</p>

<p><a href=""http://rubberduckvba.com"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Rubberduck</a> is free and open-source, under active development (disclaimer: I own the project's repository), and has a <em>code metrics</em> feature (distinct from <em>code inspections</em>) that can probably help you identify the most problematic areas (although, parsing a 10K-liner module might take a while):</p>

<p><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/WEy45.png"" alt=""Rubberduck Code Metrics""></p>

<p><em>Lines</em> is your ""lines of code"" metric; <em>Cyclomatic Complexity</em> is a rough indicator of the different possible execution paths in your code (how much sense that metric makes at a module-level aggregate is debatable); <em>Maximum Nesting</em> is also an indicator of how badly ""arrow-shaped"" code might be.</p>

<p>High values in these metrics are a sign that you may need to <em>extract methods</em>.</p>

<p>Nice to meet you! Formerly known as <em>Mat's Mug</em> (I love my SO mug!), I manage the <strong>Rubberduck</strong> open-source project, a COM add-in project written in C#, extending the glorious VBE with modern-day IDE features.</p>

<p>I must have been 12 or 13 years old when I unearthed the old Commodore-64 from my childhood, of which I remembered not much at all, beyond <em>Q*Bert!</em> and <em>Pac-Man</em>. I was thoroughly fascinated, and quickly learned the built-in BASIC 2.0, later QBasic on a ""real computer"", then VB4, VB5, and VB6 in my later teens. A few years later I started my professional life with Excel and VBA (<em>Oh wow, I can write VB6 in Excel!</em>), then I learned about databases with Access, moved on to SQL Server, and then learned C# and the .NET framework. These days I mostly work with T-SQL, SSRS, C#, and VBA.</p>

In order to make it versatile, it is advantageous to write it for a general iterator range:</p>

<pre><code>template&lt;class Iter&gt;
void function(Iter first, Iter last)
{
  // do something
}
</code></pre>

<p>Now we can invoke it in the following way, independently of how we store the arguments:</p>

<pre><code>WhateverContainer container;
function(std::begin(container), std::end(container));
</code></pre>

<p>For example, the STL relies heavily on this paradigm.</p>

<p>Now, imagine we want to invoke the function with a single argument that is not stored in a container. Of course we can write:</p>

<pre><code>const int value = 5;
std::vector&lt;int&gt; vec(1, value);
function(std::begin(vec), std::end(vec));
</code></pre>

<p>But this solution seems clumsy and wasteful to me.</p>

<p><strong>Question:</strong> Is there a better low-overhead way of creating an iterator-range-compatible representation of a single variable?</p>
","<p>You can use pointers, for once:</p>

<pre><code>function(&amp;value, &amp;value + 1);
</code></pre>

<p>In generic code, <code>std::addressof</code> instead of the unary operator <code>&amp;</code> is somewhat safer, depending on your level of paranoia.</p>

<p>You can of course wrap this in an overload for easier use:</p>

<pre><code>template &lt;class T&gt;
decltype(auto) function (T &amp;&amp;e) {
    auto p = std::addressof(e);
    return function(p, p + 1);

","<p>In the IEEE-754 basic 32-bit binary floating-point format, all integers from −16,777,216 to +16,777,216 are representable. From 16,777,216 to 33,554,432, only even integers are representable.

<p>At the beginning, I did some tests comparing a <em>for</em> loop to a <em>while</em> loop.</p>

<p>That shows that <em>for</em> loop was better.</p>

<p>But going further, for or while was not the point: the difference is related to:</p>

<pre><code>for (int l = 0; l &lt; loops;l++) {
</code></pre>

<p>or</p>

<pre><code>for (int l = 0; l != loops;l++) {
</code></pre>

<p><strong>And if you run that (under Windows 10, Visual studio 2017, release), you see that the first one is more than twice faster than the second one.</strong></p>

<p>It is hard (for a novice as I am) to understand if the compiler for some reasons is able to optimize more one or another. But...</p>

<ul>
<li><strong>Short question</strong></li>
</ul>

<p>Why?</p>

<ul>
<li><strong>Longer question</strong></li>
</ul>

<p>The complete code is the following:</p>

<p>For the '&lt;' loop:</p>

<pre><code>int forloop_inf(int loops, int iterations)
{
    int n = 0;
    int x = n;

    for (int l = 0; l &lt; loops;l++) {
        for (int i = 0; i &lt; iterations;i++) {
            n++;
            x += n;
        }
    }

    return x;
}
</code></pre>

<p>For the '!=' loop:</p>

<pre><code>int forloop_diff(int loops, int iterations)
{
    int n = 0;
    int x = n;

    for (int l = 0; l != loops;l++) {
        for (int i = 0; i != iterations;i++) {
            n++;
            x += n;
        }
    }

    return x;
}
</code></pre>

<p>In both cases, the inner calculation is just here in order to avoid the compiler skipping all the loops.</p>

<p>Respectively this is called by:</p>

<pre><code>printf(""for loop inf %f\n"", monitor_int(loops, iterations, forloop_inf, &amp;result));
printf(""%d\n"", result);
</code></pre>

<p>and</p>

<pre><code>printf(""for loop diff %f\n"", monitor_int(loops, iterations, forloop_diff, &amp;result));
printf(""%d\n"", result);
</code></pre>

<p>where loops = 10 * 1000 and iterations = 1000 * 1000.</p>

<p>And where <em>monitor_int</em> is:</p>

<pre><code>double monitor_int(int loops, int iterations, int(*func)(int, int), int *result)
{
    clock_t start = clock();

    *result = func(loops, iterations);

    clock_t stop = clock();

    return (double)(stop - start) / CLOCKS_PER_SEC;
}
</code></pre>

<p>The result in seconds is:</p>

<pre><code>for loop inf 2.227 seconds
for loop diff 4.558 seconds
</code></pre>

<p>So, even if the interest of all that is relative to the weight of what is done inside the loop compared to the loop itself, why such a difference?</p>

<p>Edit again: </p>

<p>What I feel surprising is also the following:</p>

<ul>
<li>In debug more the performance is the same (and the assembly code too)</li>
<li>So how to be confident about what you're coding if such differences appear after that? (considering I've done no mistake somewhere)</li>
</ul>
","<p>For proper benchmarking, it's important to run the functions in random order and many times.</p>

<pre><code>typedef int(signature)(int, int);

...

int main() {
    int loops, iterations, runs;

    fprintf(stderr, ""Loops: "");
    scanf(""%d"", &amp;loops);
    fprintf(stderr, ""Iterations: "");
    scanf(""%d"", &amp;iterations);
    fprintf(stderr, ""Runs: "");
    scanf(""%d"", &amp;runs);

    fprintf(stderr, ""Running for %d loops and %d iterations %d times.\n"", loops, iterations, runs);

    signature *functions[2] = {
        forloop_inf,
        forloop_diff
    };

    int result = functions[0](loops, iterations);
    for( int i = 0; i &lt; runs; i++ ) {
        int pick = rand() % 2;
        signature *function = functions[pick];

        int new_result;
        printf(""%d %f\n"", pick, monitor_int(loops, iterations, function, &amp;new_result));
        if( result != new_result ) {
            fprintf(stderr, ""got %d expected %d\n"", new_result, result);
        }
    }
}
</code></pre>

<p>Armed with this we can do 1000 runs in random order and find the average times.</p>

<p>It's also important to benchmark with optimizations turned on. Not much point in asking how fast unoptimized code will run. I'll try at <code>-O2</code> and <code>-O3</code>.</p>

<p>My findings are that with <code>Apple LLVM version 8.0.0 (clang-800.0.42.1)</code> doing 10000 loops and 1000000 iterations at <code>-O2</code> <code>forloop_inf</code> is indeed about 50% faster than <code>forloop_diff</code>.</p>

<pre><code>forloop_inf: 0.000009
forloop_diff: 0.000014
</code></pre>

<p>Looking at <a href=""https://gist.github.com/schwern/ae5bbae9637d3af4fc922671b1de3134"" rel=""noreferrer"">the generated assembly code for -O2</a> with <code>clang -O2 -S -mllvm --x86-asm-syntax=intel test.c</code> I can see <a href=""https://gist.github.com/schwern/65f940eb731b2ce75543cbeb4b6af318"" rel=""noreferrer"">many differences between the two implementations</a>. Maybe somebody who knows assembly can tell us why.</p>

<p>But at <code>-O3</code> the performance difference is no longer discernible.</p>

<pre><code>forloop_inf: 0.000002
forloop_diff: 0.000002
</code></pre>

<p>This is because <a href=""https://gist.github.com/schwern/1cf28882ccdf3599e816bd767b56cb0b"" rel=""noreferrer"">at <code>-O3</code> they are almost exactly the same</a>. One is using <a href=""https://www.aldeid.com/wiki/X86-assembly/Instructions/je"" rel=""noreferrer""><code>je</code></a> and one is using <a href=""https://www.aldeid.com/wiki/X86-assembly/Instructions/jle"" rel=""noreferrer""><code>jle</code></a>. That's it.</p>

<hr>

<p>In conclusion, when benchmarking...</p>

<ul>
<li>Do many runs.</li>
<li>Randomize the order.</li>
<li>Compile and run as close as you can do how you would in production.

<ul>
<li>In this case that means turning on compiler optimizations.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Look at the assembly code.</li>
</ul>

<p>And most of all.</p>

<ul>
<li>Pick the safest code, not the fastest.</li>
</ul>

<p><code>i &lt; max</code> is safer than <code>i != max</code> because it will still terminate if <code>i</code> somehow jumps over <code>max</code>.</p>

<p>As demonstrated, with optimizations turned on, they're both so fast that even not fully optimized they can whip through 10,000,000,000 iterations in 0.000009 seconds. <code>i &lt; max</code> or <code>i != max</code> is unlikely to be a performance bottleneck, rather whatever you're doing 10 billion times is.</p>

<p>But <code>i != max</code> could lead to a bug.</p>

  <p>As float implies the use <strong>of the block layout</strong>, it modifies the computed

<p><a href=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/sqJ2x.png"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer""><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/sqJ2x.png"" alt=""enter image description here""></a></p>

<p>Which means that your floated <code>span</code> become <strong>block elements</strong> inside an <strong>inline element</strong> that breaks your layout.</p>

<p>You can also notice that <code>padding-top</code>/<code>padding-bottom</code> and <code>border-top</code>/<code>border-bottom</code> doesn't affect the height of the <code>outer</code> div.

<p>Now some general tips for writing reducers:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>how must be the reduce call back function? </p>

<p>You either take an approach with an accumulator, then the reducer should apply a modification to the accumulator based on the current element and return it:</p>

<pre><code>(acc, el) =&gt; acc
</code></pre>

<p>Or if accumulator and the elements have the sane type and are logically equal, you dont need to distinguish them:</p>

<pre><code> (a, b) =&gt; a + b
</code></pre>

<blockquote>
  <p>what is the initialValue of reduce function? </p>
</blockquote>

<p>You should ask yourself <em>""What should reduce return when it is applied on an empty array?""</em></p>

<p>I curious to know, What does <code>int* p=+s;</code> do?</p>

","<p>That's a unary plus symbol which has no practical effect here. For example:</p>

<pre><code>type FunctionUnion = () =&gt; void | (p: string) =&gt; void
type FunctionIntersection = () =&gt; void &amp; (p: string) =&gt; void
</code></pre>

<p>I would like to apply a transformation to <code>FunctionUnion</code> to get <code>FunctionIntersection</code></p>
","<p>You want union to intersection?  <a href=""https://www.typescriptlang.org/docs/handbook/release-notes/typescript-2-8.html#distributive-conditional-types"" rel=""noreferrer"">Distributive conditional types</a> and <a href=""https://www.typescriptlang.org/docs/handbook/release-notes/typescript-2-8.html#type-inference-in-conditional-types"" rel=""noreferrer"">inference from conditional types</a> can do that.  (Don't know how to do intersection-to-union though.) Here's the evil magic:</p>

<pre><code>type UnionToIntersection&lt;U&gt; = 
  (U extends any ? (k: U)=&gt;void : never) extends ((k: infer I)=&gt;void) ? I : never
</code></pre>

<p>That distributes the union <code>U</code> and repackages it into a new union where all the consitutents are in contravariant position.  That allows the type to be inferred as an intersection <code>I</code>, as mentioned in the handbook:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Likewise, multiple candidates for the same type variable in contra-variant positions causes an intersection type to be inferred.</p>
</blockquote>

<hr>

<p>Let's see if it works.</p>

<p>First let me parenthesize your <code>FunctionUnion</code> and <code>FunctionIntersection</code> because TypeScript seems to bind the union/intersection more tightly than function return:</p>

<pre><code>type FunctionUnion = (() =&gt; void) | ((p: string) =&gt; void);
type FunctionIntersection = (() =&gt; void) &amp; ((p: string) =&gt; void);
</code></pre>

<p>Testing:</p>

<pre><code>type SynthesizedFunctionIntersection = UnionToIntersection&lt;FunctionUnion&gt;
// inspects as 
// type SynthesizedFunctionIntersection = (() =&gt; void) &amp; ((p: string) =&gt; void)
</code></pre>

<p>Looks good!</p>

<p>Be careful that in general <code>UnionToIntersection&lt;&gt;</code> exposes some details of what TypeScript thinks is an actual union.  For example, <code>boolean</code> is apparently internally represented as <code>true | false</code>, so</p>

<pre><code>type Weird = UnionToIntersection&lt;string | number | boolean&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>becomes</p>

<pre><code>type Weird = string &amp; number &amp; true &amp; false
</code></pre>

<p>Hope that helps.  Good luck!</p>

<p>Then why do I have this behaviour?</p>

</pre></code></p>

<p>which are even more surprising now.</p>

<p><strong>EDIT 2:</strong> I see that this question has been marked as a duplicate of an earlier question that asks about the monomorphism restriction. When I encountered this problem, I had no idea that this was due to the restriction. So if someone finds him/herself in my position I guess the answer to this question would be helpful.</p>
","<p>For the first part of this answer, <code>:set -XNoMonomorphismRestriction</code> in ghci. It will be explained later.</p>

<p>Naively, one would expect that in Haskell <code>let x = 5 in (x + 1,x + 2)</code> would always be equivalent to <code>(\x -&gt; (x + 1, x + 2)) 5</code>. But they have different types!</p>

<pre><code>let x = 5 in (x + 1,x + 2) :: (Num a, Num b) =&gt; (a, b)

(\x -&gt; (x + 1,x + 2)) 5 :: Num b =&gt; (b, b)
</code></pre>

<p>The reason is a feature of Haskell called <a href=""https://www.haskell.org/tutorial/pitfalls.html"" rel=""noreferrer"">let-bound polymorphism</a>. Unlike lambda-bound identifiers, identifiers bound in a <code>let</code> can be instantiated in different ways in the body of the <code>let</code>. For example:</p>

<pre><code>ghci&gt; let f = id in (f True, f 'a')
(True,'a')

ghci&gt; (\f -&gt; (f True, f 'a')) id
*** ERROR ***
</code></pre>

<p>Now, you didn't give a type signature to your <code>fib</code> funtion, and the one that is deduced is something like</p>

<pre><code>fib :: (Ord a, Num a) =&gt; a -&gt; a
</code></pre>

<p>that will work for different instances of <code>Num</code> like <code>Int</code>, <code>Float</code>, etc.</p>

<p>But because of this, when you write <code>x `seq` x</code>, ghci can't be sure that the two <code>x</code>s are actually of the same type! And if they might be different, then they can't be shared.</p>

<p>That's the reason why <code>(\x -&gt; x `seq` x) (fib 30)</code> does have sharing. Because the <code>x</code> is lambda-bound, the compiler is sure that both occurrences really are the same value. Same for <code>let x = (fib 30) :: Int in x `seq` x</code> because we have removed polymorphism using an explicit type.</p>

<p>There's another way out. Turning on the <a href=""https://wiki.haskell.org/Monomorphism_restriction"" rel=""noreferrer""><code>-XMonomorphismRestriction</code></a> extension increases the amount of type defaulting, causing <code>let</code> expressions to be more monomorphic than one might expect. That should be enough to recover sharing in this case as well.</p>

<p>i.e.
<code>funcPtr</code> points to <code>func1(int a, int b)</code>, and <code>func1</code> returns a pointer to another function <code>func2(int a, int b)</code>. <code>func2</code> also returns a function pointer with the same signature as <code>func1</code>. </p>

<pre><code>TYPE funcPtr = func1;
funcPtr = funcPtr(0, 1);
</code></pre>

<p>How does one declare <code>funcPtr</code>? What should <code>TYPE</code> be?</p>
","<h3>Unresolvable self-reference</h3>

<p>This is not possible directly. If you try to define a function pointer type where the function's return type is its own type, you will run into an unresolved self-reference, and that would require infinite recursion to resolve.</p>

<pre><code>typedef funcType (*funcType)(void);
</code></pre>

<h3>Return a <code>struct</code></h3>

<p>You can instead declare that the function return a structure, and the structure can contain a pointer to such a function.</p>

<pre><code>struct func {
    struct func (*func) (void);
};

struct func foo (void);
struct func bar (void);

struct func foo (void) { return (struct func){ bar }; }
struct func bar (void) { return (struct func){ foo }; }

...
    struct func funcPtr = { foo };
    funcPtr = funcPtr.func();
</code></pre>

<h3>Return a different function pointer type</h3>

<p>If you prefer to stick to strictly pointers, you will need to resort to defining functions that return a different function pointer type. Thus, the result of the call would have to be cast back to the proper pointer type before being invoked.</p>

<pre><code>typedef void (*funcPtrType)(void);
typedef funcPtrType funcType(void);

funcType foo;
funcType bar;

funcPtrType foo (void) { return (funcPtrType)bar; }
funcPtrType bar (void) { return (funcPtrType)foo; }

...
    funcType *p = foo;
    p = (funcType *)p();
</code></pre>

<h3>Return an index<sup>&dagger;</sup></h3>

<p>You could instead define your functions to return an index to a table that represents the function that should be invoked.</p>

<pre><code>enum funcEnum { fooEnum, barEnum };
typedef enum funcEnum (*funcType)(void);

enum funcEnum foo (void) { return barEnum; }
enum funcEnum bar (void) { return fooEnum; }

funcType funcTable[] = { [fooEnum] = foo, [barEnum] = bar };

<p>It means pointer is scalar type. </p>

<p>Now if we go to definition of literal type:</p>

  <p>A type is a literal type if it is:</p>
  
  <ul>
  <li>a scalar type; or </li>
  <li>a reference type; or </li>
  <li>an array of literal type; or

  <li>all of its non-static data members and base classes are of literal types.</li>
  </ul></li>

<p>Now, combining above 2 statements, it means pointer is literal type. However pointer can not be constexpr. can someone please clarify?</p>

<p>pointer1 is fine but pointer 2 gives error. does that mean pointer to global is fine but to automatic variable is not? Does standard mention this anywhere ?</p>
","<p>Pointers are literal types. They can be <code>constexpr</code> under certain conditions:</p>

  <h3>[expr.const] 6</h3>

<hr>

<p>Apparently GCC (with <code>-pedantic-errors -std=c++11</code>/<code>14</code>/<code>17</code>) happily accepts out-of-range constexpr pointer arithmetic: <code>constexpr int *ptr = &amp;x - 10;</code>, which seems like a bug to me.</p>

<p>For testing a game art style I thought of, I want to render a 3D world in pixel-art form. So for example, take a scene like this (but rendered with certain coloring / style so as to look good once pixelated):</p>

<p><a href=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/OD3tJ.jpg"" rel=""noreferrer""><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/OD3tJ.jpg"" alt=""Original Image""></a></p>

<p>And make it look something like this:</p>

<p><a href=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/fohVM.jpg"" rel=""noreferrer""><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/fohVM.jpg"" alt=""Pixelated Image""></a></p>

<p>By playing with different ways of styling the 3D source I think the pixelated output could look nice. Of course to get this effect one just sizes the image down to ~80p and upscales it to 1080p with nearest neighbor resampling. But it's more efficient to render straight to an 80p canvas to begin with and just do the upscaling.</p>

<p>This is not typically how one would use a shader, to resize a bitmap in nearest neighbor format, but the performance on it is better than any other way I've found to make such a conversion in real time.</p>

<h3>My code:</h3>

<p>My buffer for the bitmap is stored in row major, as <code>r1, g1, b1, a1, r2, g2, b2, a2...</code> and I'm using <a href=""https://github.com/gpujs/gpu.js"" rel=""noreferrer"">gpu.js</a> which essentially converts this JS func into a shader. My goal is to take one bitmap and return one at larger scale with nearest-neighbor scaling, so each pixel becomes a 2x2 square or 3x3 and so on. Assume <code>inputBuffer</code> is a scaled fraction of size of the output determined by the <code>setOutput</code> method.</p>

<pre><code>var pixelateMatrix = gpu.createKernel(function(inputBuffer, width, height, scale) {
  var y = Math.floor((this.thread.x / (width[0] * 4)) / scale[0]);
  var x = Math.floor((this.thread.x % (width[0] * 4)) / scale[0]);
  var remainder = this.thread.x % 4;
  return inputBuffer[(x * y) + remainder]; 
}).setOutput([width * height * 4]);
</code></pre>

<p><a href=""https://jsfiddle.net/31tw9nh3/"" rel=""noreferrer"">JSFiddle</a></p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Keep in mind it's iterating over a new buffer of the full size output,
  so I have to find the correct coordinates that will exist in the
  smaller <code>sourceBuffer</code> based on the current index in the
  <code>outputBuffer</code> (index is exposed by the lib as <code>this.thread.x</code>).</p>
</blockquote>

<h3>What's happening instead:</h3>

<p>This, instead of making a nearest neighbor upscale, is making a nice little rainbow (above is the small normal render, below is the result of the shader, and to the right you can see some debug logging with stats about the input and output buffers):</p>

<p><strong>Original Answer</strong></p>

<p>I have gotten close but two issues are left</p>

<ol>
<li>The image is getting inverted</li>
<li>Sometimes your <code>inputBuffer</code> size is not a multiple of 4, which causes it to misbehave. </li>
</ol>

<p>Below is code I used</p>

<pre><code>var pixelateMatrix = gpu.createKernel(function(inputBuffer, width, height, scale) {
   var current_index = Math.floor(this.thread.x/4); 
   var row = Math.floor(current_index / (width[0] * scale[0]) );
   var col = Math.floor((current_index % width[0])/scale[0]);
   var index_old = Math.floor(row * (width[0] / scale[0])) + col;
   var remainder = this.thread.x % 4;
   return inputBuffer[index_old * 4 + remainder];

}).setOutput([width * height * 4]);
</code></pre>

However, the C standard says:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>The first operand is evaluated; there is a sequence point between its evaluation and the
  evaluation of the second or third operand (whichever is evaluated). The second operand
  is evaluated only if the first compares unequal to 0; the third operand is evaluated only if
  the first compares equal to 0; the result is the value of the second or third operand
  (whichever is evaluated), converted to the type described below.110)</p>
</blockquote>

<p>For example, the following C code</p>

<pre><code>#include &lt;stdio.h&gt;

int main() {
    int a, b;
    scanf(""%d %d"", &amp;a, &amp;b);
    int c= a &gt; b ? a + 1 : 2 + b;

movl    4(%rsp), %ecx
movl    $1, %edi
leal    2(%rcx), %eax

cmpl    %ecx, %esi
movl    $.LC1, %esi
cmovle  %eax, %edx
xorl    %eax, %eax
call    __printf_chk

<p>According to the standard, the conditional expression will only have one branch evaluated. But here both branches are evaluated, which is against the standard's semantics. Is this optimization against the C standard? Or do many compiler optimizations have something inconsistent with the language standard?</p>
","<p>The C Standard describes an abstract machine executing C code. A compiler is free to perform any optimization as long as that abstraction is not violated, i.e. a conforming program cannot tell the difference.</p>

<p>I was trying to find an algorithm that will tell me which <code>s</code>s are missing. As you can see, the list consists of consecutive <code>s</code>s (<code>s1</code>, <code>s2</code>, etc.).</p>

<p>At first I went with this solution:</p>

<p><div class=""snippet"" data-lang=""js"" data-hide=""false"" data-console=""true"" data-babel=""false"">
<div class=""snippet-code"">
<pre class=""snippet-code-js lang-js prettyprint-override""><code>    var arr = [""s00"",""s01"",""s02"",""s03"",""s04"",""s05"",""s07"",""s08"",""s09"",""s10"",""s11"",""s12"",""s13"",""s14"",""s17"",""s19"",""s20"",""s21"",""s22"",""s24"",""s25"",""s26"",""s27"",""s28"",""s30"",""s32"",""s33"",""s34"",""s36"",""s38"",""s39"",""s41"",""s43"",""s44"",""s45"",""s46"",""s47"",""s48"",""s49"",""s50"",""s51"",""s52"",""s53"",""s54"",""s55"",""s56"",""s58"",""s60"",""s61"",""s62"",""s63"",""s64"",""s65"",""s67"",""s69"",""s70""];
for (var i=1;i&lt;arr.length;i++){
    var thisI = parseInt(arr[i].toLowerCase().split(""s"")[1]);
    var prevI = parseInt(arr[i-1].toLowerCase().split(""s"")[1]);
    if (thisI != prevI+1)
      console.log(`Seems like ${prevI+1} is missing. thisI is ${thisI} and prevI is ${prevI}`)
}</code></pre>
</div>
</div>
</p>

<p>But this method fails for more than one consecutive numbers missing (<code>s15</code>, <code>s16</code>). So I added a <code>while</code> loop which works.</p>

</p>

<p>However, I feel like I'm overly complicating things.
I thought of creating an ideal array:</p>

<pre><code>var idealArray = [];
for (var i =0; i&lt;200;i++) {
  idealArray.push(i)
}
</code></pre>

<p>And then, while checking, tamper with my array (<code>arr</code>) so that the loop checks two arrays of the same length. I.e., use this solution:</p>

<p><div class=""snippet"" data-lang=""js"" data-hide=""false"" data-console=""true"" data-babel=""false"">
<div class=""snippet-code"">
<pre class=""snippet-code-js lang-js prettyprint-override""><code>var idealArray = [];

for (let i = 0; i&lt;idealArray.length;i++){
  if (parseInt(arr[i].toLowerCase().split(""s"")[1]) != idealArray[i]) {
    console.log(`Seems like ${idealArray[i]}is missing`);
    arr.splice(i,0,""dummyel"")
  }
}</code></pre>
</div>
</div>
</p>

<p>But, once again, I have the feeling that creating this second array is not very efficient either (thinking of a big list, I'd waste unnecessary space).</p>

<p>So... how do I efficiently perform this task in JavaScript? (Efficiently meaning as close to O(1) as possible both for time complexity and for space complexity.)</p>
","<p>Since you know you are expecting a sequential array, I don't know why it needs to be more complicated than a loop through numbers <code>arr[0]</code> through <code>arr[end]</code> while keeping a counter to know where you are in the array. This will run at O(n), but I don't think you can improve on that — you need to look at every element at least once in the worst case.</p>

<p><strong>EDIT:</strong></p>

<p>After thinking a bit about the comments below, I made a recursive approach that splits the array and checks each half. Mostly as an experiment, not as a practical solution. This does in fact run with fewer than <code>n</code> iterations in most cases, but I couldn't find a case where it was actually faster Also, I just pushed indexes showing where the gaps are to make the structure easier to see and test. <s>And as you'll see, because it's recursive the results aren't in order.</s></p>

<p>Here a sample of the full code for generating and saving 100 of these images (with seed 0), the above are the first four images generated by this code.</p>

<pre><code>import numpy as np
from PIL import Image

np.random.seed(0)
img_arrays = np.random.random((100, 256, 256, 3)) * 255

<p>The above are four different images created using <code>PIL.Image.fromarray()</code> on four different NumPy arrays created using <code>numpy.random.random((256, 256, 3)) * 255</code> to generate a 256 by 256 grid of RGB values in four different Python instances (the same thing also happens in the same instance).</p>

<p>I noticed that this only happens (in my limited testing) when the width and height of the image is a power of two, I am not sure how to interpret that.</p>

<p>Although it may be hard to see due to browser anti-aliasing (you can download the images and view them in image viewers with no anti-aliasing), there are clear purple-brown columns of pixels every 8th column starting from the 3rd column of every image. To make sure, I tested this on 100 different images and they all followed this pattern.</p>

<p>What is going on here? I am guessing that patterns like this are the reason that people always say to use cryptographically secure random number generators when true randomness is required, but is there a concrete explanation behind why this is happening in particular?</p>
","<p>Don't blame Numpy, blame PIL / Pillow. ;) You're generating floats, but PIL expects integers, and its float to int conversion is not doing what we want. Further research is required to determine exactly what PIL <em>is</em> doing... </p>

<p>In the mean time, you can get rid of those lines by explicitly converting your values to unsigned 8 bit integers:</p>

<pre><code>img_arrays = (np.random.random((100, 256, 256, 3)) * 255).astype(np.uint8)
</code></pre>

<p>As FHTMitchell notes in the comments, a more efficient form is</p>

<pre><code>img_arrays = np.random.randint(0, 256, (100, 256, 256, 3), dtype=np.uint8) 
</code></pre>

<p>Here's typical output from that modified code:</p>

<p>The PIL Image.fromarray function has a known bug, as described <a href=""https://stackoverflow.com/questions/2761645/error-converting-pil-bw-images-to-numpy-arrays"">here</a>.

Due to a task I decided to use an abstract superclass with multiple constructors:</p>

<p><strong>Abstract Superclass:</strong></p>

<pre><code>protected ListSortierer()
{
  this( null, null );
}

protected ListSortierer( List&lt;E&gt; li )
{
  this( li, null );
}

protected ListSortierer( Comparator&lt;E&gt; comp )
{
  this( null, comp );     
}

protected ListSortierer( List&lt;E&gt; li, Comparator&lt;E&gt; com )
{
  this.original = Optional.ofNullable( li );
  this.comp = Optional.ofNullable( com );
}
</code></pre>

<p>To access each of these constructors I needed multiple constructors in the subclass as well.</p>

<p><strong>BubbleSort.java:</strong></p>

<pre><code>public ListBubbleSort()
{
  super();
}

public ListBubbleSort( List&lt;E&gt; li )
{
  super( li );
}

public ListBubbleSort( Comparator&lt;E&gt; com )
{
  super( com );
}

public ListBubbleSort( List&lt;E&gt; li, Comparator&lt;E&gt; com )
{
  super( li, com );
}
</code></pre>

<p>In this case every constructor of the subclass calls the constructor of the superclass immediately.It came to my mind that I could refer to the own constructor again and pass <code>null</code> values:</p>

<pre><code>public ListBubbleSort()
{
  this( null, null );
}

public ListBubbleSort( List&lt;E&gt; li )
{
   this( li, null );
}

public ListBubbleSort( Comparator&lt;E&gt; com )
{
   this( null, com );
}

public ListBubbleSort( List&lt;E&gt; li, Comparator&lt;E&gt; com )
{
   super( li, com );
}
</code></pre>

<p>Doing so would allow me to omit 3 of the overloaded constructors in the abstract superclass but would enforce that every subclass follows the same pattern.</p>

<p>My question is: What is the the better approach in case of consistency?Handle missing values in the abstract superclass or in the subclass? Does it make a difference regarding instantiation or is it just a matter of opinion?</p>

<p>Given <code>N</code> number of triangles in the tessellation, I have a <code>N X 3 X 3</code> array which stores <code>(x, y, z)</code> coordinates of all three vertices of each triangle. My goal is to find for each triangle the neighbouring triangle sharing the same edge. The is an intricate part is the whole setup that I do not repeat the neighbour count. That is if triangle <code>j</code> was already counted as a neighbour of triangle <code>i</code>, then triangle <code>i</code> should not be again counted as neighbour of triangle <code>j</code>. This way, I would like to have a map storing list of neighbours for each index triangle. If I start with a triangle in index <code>i</code>, then index <code>i</code> will have three neighbours, and all others will have two or less. As an illustration suppose I have an array which stores vertices of the triangle:</p>

<pre><code>import numpy as np
vertices = np.array([[[2.0, 1.0, 3.0],[3.0, 1.0, 2.0],[1.2, 2.5, -2.0]],
                     [[3.0, 1.0, 2.0],[1.0, 2.0, 3.0],[1.2, -2.5, -2.0]],

                     [[1.0, 2.0, 3.0],[2.0, 1.0, 3.0],[2.2, 2.0, 1.0]],

</code></pre>

<p>Suppose I start my count from vertex index <code>2</code>, i.e. the one with the vertices <code>[[1.0, 2.0, 3.0],[2.0, 1.0, 3.0],[3.0, 1.0, 2.0]]</code>, then, I would like my output to be something like:</p>

Following the answer from @Ajax1234, I think a good way of storing the output is just like how @Ajax1234 has demonstrated. However, there is ambiguity in that output, in a sense that it is not possible to know whose neighbour is which. Although the example array are not good, I have an actual vertices from icosahedron, then if I start with a given triangle, I am guaranteed to have 3 neighbours for the first one, and two neighbours for rest (until all the triangle counts deplete). In this regard, suppose I have a following array:</p>

<pre><code>vertices1 = [[[2, 1, 3], [3, 1, 2], [1, 2, -2]], 
            [[3, 1, 2], [1, 2, 3], [1, -2, 2]], 
            [[1, 2, 3], [2, 1, 3], [3, 1, 2]], 
            [[1, 2, 3], [2, 1, 3], [2, 2, 1]],
            [[1, 2, 3], [2, 2, 1], [4, 1, 0]], 
            [[2, 1, 3], [2, 2, 1], [-4, 1, 0]],
            [[3, 1, 3], [2, 2, 1], [-4, 1, 0]],
            [[8, 1, 2], [1, 2, 3], [1, -2, 2]]]
</code></pre>

<p>The BFS algorithm shown in the answer below by @Ajax1234 gives the output of </p>

<pre><code>[0, 1, 3, 7, 4, 5, 6]
</code></pre>

<p>while if I just swap the position of the last element such that</p>

<pre><code>vertices2 = [[[2, 1, 3], [3, 1, 2], [1, 2, -2]], 
            [[3, 1, 2], [1, 2, 3], [1, -2, 2]], 
            [[1, 2, 3], [2, 1, 3], [3, 1, 2]], 
            [[1, 2, 3], [2, 1, 3], [2, 2, 1]],
            [[1, 2, 3], [2, 2, 1], [4, 1, 0]], 
            [[8, 1, 2], [1, 2, 3], [1, -2, 2]],
            [[2, 1, 3], [2, 2, 1], [-4, 1, 0]],
            [[3, 1, 3], [2, 2, 1], [-4, 1, 0]]]
</code></pre>

<p>which gives an output of </p>

<pre><code>[0, 1, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7].
</code></pre>

<p>This is kind of ambiguous, as the positions in the gird have not been changed at all, they were just swapped. Therefore, I would like to have a consistent way the search is carried. For example, first time search of neighbours at index 2 gives <code>[0, 1, 3]</code> for both <code>vertices1</code> and <code>vertices2</code>, now I would like the search to be at index 0, which finds nothing and thus go to next element 1 should find index <code>7</code> for <code>vertices1</code> and index <code>5</code> for <code>vertices2</code>. Thus the current output should be <code>[0, 1, 3, 7]</code>, <code>[0, 1, 3, 5]</code> for <code>vertices1</code> and <code>vertices2</code> respectively. Next we go to index <code>3</code>, and so on. After we have exhausted all the search, the final output for the first should be </p>

<pre><code>[0, 1, 3, 7, 4, 5, 6]
</code></pre>

<p>and that for the second should</p>

<pre><code>[0, 1, 3, 5, 4, 6, 7].
</code></pre>

<p>What would be the efficient way to achieve this?</p>

<p>Oftentimes the need arises to remove <strong>punctuation</strong> during text cleaning and pre-processing. Punctuation is defined as any character in <code>string.punctuation</code>:</p>

<pre><code>&gt;&gt;&gt; import string
string.punctuation
'!""#$%&amp;\'()*+,-./:;&lt;=&gt;?@[\\]^_`{|}~'

<p>This is a common enough problem and has been asked before ad nauseam. The most idiomatic solution uses pandas <code>str.replace</code>. However, for situations which involve a <em>lot</em> of text, a more performant solution may need to be considered. </p>

<p>What are some good, performant alternatives to <code>str.replace</code> when dealing with hundreds of thousands of records?</p>
","<p>Using numpy we can gain a healthy speedup over the best methods posted so far. The basic strategy is similar---make one big super string. But the processing seems much faster in numpy, presumably because we fully exploit the simplicity of the nothing-for-something replacement op.</p>

<p>For smaller (less than <code>0x110000</code> characters total) problems we automatically find a separator, for larger problems we use a slower method that does not rely on <code>str.split</code>.</p>

<p>Note that I have moved all precomputables out of the functions. Also note, that <code>translate</code> and <code>pd_translate</code> get to know the only possible separator for the three largest problems for free whereas <code>np_multi_strat</code> has to compute it or to fall back to the separator-less strategy. And finally, note that for the last three data points I switch to a more ""interesting"" problem; <code>pd_replace</code> and <code>re_sub</code> because they are not equivalent to the other methods had to be excluded for that.</p>

<h2>On the algorithm:</h2>

<p>The basic strategy is actually quite simple. There are only <code>0x110000</code> different unicode characters. As OP frames the challenge in terms of huge data sets, it is perfectly worthwhile making a lookup table that has <code>True</code> at the character id's that we want to keep and <code>False</code> at the ones that have to go --- the punctuation in our example.</p>

<p>Such a lookup table can be used for bulk loookup using numpy's advanced indexing. As lookup is fully vectorized and essentially amounts to dereferencing an array of pointers it is much faster than for example dictionary lookup. Here we make use of numpy view casting which allows to reinterpret unicode characters as integers essentially for free.</p>

<p>Using the data array which contains just one monster string reinterpreted as a sequence of numbers to index into the lookup table results in a boolean mask. This mask can then be used to filter out the unwanted characters. Using boolean indexing this, too, is a single line of code.</p>

<p>So far so simple. The tricky bit is chopping up the monster string back into its parts. If we have  a separator, i.e. one character that does not occur in the data or the punctuation list, then it still is easy. Use this character to join and resplit. However, automatically finding a separator is challenging and indeed accounts for half the loc in the implementation below.</p>

<p>Alternatively, we can keep the split points in a separate data structure, track how they move as a consequence of deleting unwanted characters and then use them to slice the processed monster string. As chopping up into parts of uneven length is not numpy's strongest suit, this method is slower than <code>str.split</code> and only used as a fallback when a separator would be too expensive to calculate if it existed in the first place.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>I think it would depend on how are /dev/shm and /tmp mounted. 
  If they are both mounted as tmpfs I'm assuming there won't be any difference. 
  if for some reason /tmp is not mapped as tmpfs (and I think is mapped as tmpfs by default by systemd), chrome shared memory management always maps files into memory when creating an anonymous shared files, so even in that case shouldn't be much difference. I guess you could force telemetry tests with the flag enabled and see how it goes.</p>
  
  <p>As for why not use by default, it was a pushed back by the shared memory team, I guess it makes sense it should be useing /dev/shm for shared memory by default.</p>
  
  <p>Ultimately all this should be moving to use memfd_create, but I don't think that's going to happen any time soon, since it will require refactoring Chrome memory management significantly. </p>

myNums.filter(_ &gt; 99)
// Seq[Int] = List() // result = empty, same type
</code></pre>
","<p>In this answer, I will assume that you are talking about <code>filter</code> on <code>Set</code> (the situation seems messier for other datatypes).</p>

<p>Let's first fix what we are talking about. I will talk specifically about the following function (in Scala):</p>

<pre><code>def filter[A](p: A =&gt; Boolean): Set[A] =&gt; Set[A] = 
                                     s =&gt; s filter p
</code></pre>

<p>When we write it down this way, we see clearly that it's a polymorphic function with type parameter <code>A</code> that maps predicates <code>A =&gt; Boolean</code> to functions that map <code>Set[A]</code> to other <code>Set[A]</code>. To make it a ""morphism"", we would have to find some categories first, in which this thing could be a ""morphism"". One might hope that it's natural transformation, and therefore a morphism in the category of endofunctors on the ""default ambient category-esque structure"" usually referred to as ""<code>Hask</code>"" (or ""<code>Scal</code>""? ""<code>Scala</code>""?). To show that it's natural, we would have to check that the following diagram commutes for every <code>f: B =&gt; A</code>:</p>

<pre><code>                       - o f
Hom[A, Boolean] ---------------------&gt; Hom[B, Boolean]
     |                                       |
     |                                       |
     |                                       |
     | filter[A]                             | filter[B]
     |                                       |
     V                  ???                  V
Hom[Set[A], Set[A]] ---------------&gt; Hom[Set[B], Set[B]]
</code></pre>

<p>however, here we fail immediately, because it's not clear what to even put on the horizontal arrow at the bottom, since the assignment <code>A -&gt; Hom[Set[A], Set[A]]</code> doesn't even seem functorial (for the same reasons why <code>A -&gt; End[A]</code> is not functorial, see <a href=""https://stackoverflow.com/a/48854263/2707792"">here</a> and also <a href=""https://mathoverflow.net/a/21329/79922"">here</a>).</p>

<p>The only ""categorical"" structure that I see here for a <em>fixed</em> type <code>A</code> is the following:</p>

<ul>
<li>Predicates on <code>A</code> can be considered to be a partially ordered set with implication, that is <code>p LEQ q</code> if <code>p</code> implies <code>q</code> (i.e. either <code>p(x)</code> must be false, or <code>q(x)</code> must be true for all <code>x: A</code>).</li>
<li>Analogously, on functions <code>Set[A] =&gt; Set[A]</code>, we can define a partial order with <code>f LEQ g</code> whenever for each set <code>s: Set[A]</code> it holds that <code>f(s)</code> is subset of <code>g(s)</code>.</li>
</ul>

<p>Then <code>filter[A]</code> would be monotonic, and therefore a functor between poset-categories. But that's somewhat boring. </p>

<p>Of course, for each fixed <code>A</code>, it (or rather its eta-expansion) is also just a function from <code>A =&gt; Boolean</code> to <code>Set[A] =&gt; Set[A]</code>, so it's automatically a ""morphism"" in the ""<code>Hask</code>-category"". But that's even more boring. </p>

","<p>Thanks to <a href=""https://stackoverflow.com/users/2756719/t-c"">@T.C.</a> we have:</p>

<p>According to <a href=""https://timsong-cpp.github.io/cppwp/n3337/temp.param#3"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">[temp.param]/3</a>:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>A <em>type-parameter</em> whose identifier does not follow an ellipsis defines its <em>identifier</em> to be a <em>typedef-name</em> (if declared with <code>class</code> or <code>typename</code>) ... in the scope of the template declaration.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>So it works just like a <code>typedef</code>.</p>

<p>And then <a href=""https://timsong-cpp.github.io/cppwp/n3337/class.name#5"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">[class.name]/5</a>:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>If a <em>typedef-name</em> that names a <em>cv-qualified</em> class type is used where a <em>class-name</em> is required, the <em>cv-qualifiers</em> are ignored.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Hence GCC is right, <code>const</code> should be stripped when inheriting from <code>T</code>, since a <em>class-name</em> is required <a href=""https://timsong-cpp.github.io/cppwp/n3337/class.derived#nt:class-or-decltype"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">at that point</a>, as well as in the <a href=""https://timsong-cpp.github.io/cppwp/n3337/class.qual#2.2"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer""><code>using T::T;</code></a> <em>inheriting constructors</em> declaration.</p>

<pre><code>@Injectable({
  providedIn: 'root',

export class HeroService {}

<p>However the documentation still also refers to registering the service in the module <code>providers</code> array in the module metadata just like we did in Angular 5:</p>

<pre><code>@NgModule({
  providers: [HeroService],

export class AppModule {}

<p>so which method should be used to make the injector aware of the service that it should inject &amp; is the module provider's array method will be deprecated?</p>
","<p>Basically you can use either, But as per new CLI <code>provideIn</code> will be automatically added while creating <code>service</code></p>

<h1>providedIn</h1>

<blockquote>
  <p>There is now a new, recommended, way to register a provider, directly
  inside the <code>@Injectable()</code> decorator, using the new providedIn
  attribute. It accepts <code>'root'</code> as a value or any module of your
  application. When you use <code>'root'</code>, your injectable will be registered
  as a singleton in the application, and you don’t need to add it to the
  providers of the root module. Similarly, if you use <code>providedIn: UsersModule</code>, 
  the injectable is registered as a provider of the
  <code>UsersModule</code> without adding it to the providers of the module.</p>
  
  <p>This new way has been introduced to have a better tree-shaking in the
  application. Currently a service added to the providers of a module
  will end up in the final bundle, even if it is not used in the
  application, which is a bit sad.</p>

<p>Any idea how I can prevent from receiving <code>onChanged</code> twice, for a same data?</p>

<h2>Demo</h2>

<p>I created a demo project to demonstrate this problem.</p>

<p>As you can see, after I perform write operation (Click on <strong>ADD TRASHED NOTE</strong> button) in <code>MainFragment</code>, when I switch to <code>TrashFragment</code>, I expect <code>onChanged</code> in <code>TrashFragment</code> will only be called once. However, it is being called twice.</p>

","<p>I have introduced just one change in your code:</p>

<pre><code>noteViewModel = ViewModelProviders.of(this).get(NoteViewModel.class);
</code></pre>

<p>instead of:</p>

<pre><code>noteViewModel = ViewModelProviders.of(getActivity()).get(NoteViewModel.class);
</code></pre>

<p>in <code>Fragment</code>'s <code>onCreate(Bundle)</code> methods. And now it works seamlessly.</p>

<p>In your version you obtained a reference of of <code>NoteViewModel</code> common to both Fragments (from Activity). <code>ViewModel</code> had <code>Observer</code> registered in previous Fragment, I think. Therefore <code>LiveData</code> kept reference to both <code>Observer</code>'s (in <code>MainFragment</code> and <code>TrashFragment</code>) and called both values.</p>

<p>So I guess the conclusion might be, that you should obtain <code>ViewModel</code> from <code>ViewModelProviders</code> from:</p>

<ul>
<li><code>Fragment</code> in <code>Fragment</code></li>
<li><code>Activity</code> in <code>Activity</code></li>
</ul>

<p>Btw.</p>

<p><code>noteViewModel.getTrashedNotesLiveData().removeObservers(this);</code></p>

<p>is not necessary in Fragments, however I would advise putting it in <code>onStop</code>.</p>

If you plug in the <code>type EmailFilter</code> definition into the type in the second line, you obtain</p>

<p>i.e. it filters all emails with length greater than or equal 100. Thus, with suitably defined example mails <code>shortMail</code> and <code>longMail</code>, you would obtain:</p>

","<p>To define the <code>__bool__</code> method used by a class, not its instances, you need to modify <em>its</em> class.  You do that by writing a <a href=""https://stackoverflow.com/q/100003/5079316"">metaclass</a>.</p>

<pre><code>class FalseMeta(type):
    def __bool__(self):

</code></pre>

<p>I need double backslash <code>""\\b""</code> for word boundaries, but just single backslash <code>""\s""</code> is acceptable for whitespace characters. Why is the double backslash required for word boundaries?</p>
","<p><code>\b</code> has a special meaning: it's the backspace character. <code>\s</code> and many other <code>\&lt;something&gt;</code> sequences have no special meaning so <code>\</code> is then interpreted as a literal slash.</p>

<pre><code>&gt;&gt;&gt; '\b'
'\x08'
&gt;&gt;&gt; print('123\b456')
12456
&gt;&gt;&gt; '\s'
'\\s'
&gt;&gt;&gt; print('\s')
\s
&gt;&gt;&gt; print('\b')

&gt;&gt;&gt; # nothing visible printed above
</code></pre>

<p>To make things easier, you should usually use raw string literals when writing regexes. This generally prevents <code>\</code> from being interpreted as an escape character in the Python string sense, so that it works properly in your regex. For example:</p>

<pre><code>&gt;&gt;&gt; r'\b'
'\\b'
&gt;&gt;&gt; print(r'\b')
\b

","<p>We can just reason about the types and then look for the function in Hoogle.</p>

<p>For example, you need a function, which accepts a <code>String</code> and returns a list of <code>String</code>s, e.g <code>String -&gt; [String]</code>. Let's look for it:</p>

<p><a href=""https://www.haskell.org/hoogle/?hoogle=String+-%3E+%5BString%5D"" rel=""noreferrer"">https://www.haskell.org/hoogle/?hoogle=String+-%3E+%5BString%5D</a></p>

<p>The first one is <code>lines</code> with a description:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>breaks a string up into a list of strings at newline characters. The resulting strings do not contain newlines.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Hm, but we need to break at spaces, not only at newline characters. Maybe there's something else?</p>

<p>What about <code>words</code>?</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>breaks a string up into a list of words, which were delimited by white space.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Yea, the right, one.</p>

<p>Thus, the answer is:</p>

<p>You need the <a href=""http://hackage.haskell.org/package/base-4.11.1.0/docs/Prelude.html#v:words"" rel=""noreferrer"">words</a> function:</p>

<p><code>words ""aaa bbb ccc dddd""</code> returns <code>[""aaa"",""bbb"",""ccc"",""dddd""]</code></p>

<p>I did some research, and found the only case ""x+=y"" and ""x=x+y"" is not equivalent is when operant types are not the same, however in this case, ""n"" is type of <code>int</code>, and ""0&amp;1"" shoud be a type of <code>int</code> (according to this question <a href=""https://stackoverflow.com/questions/2279718/why-does-bitwise-and-of-two-short-values-result-in-an-int-value-in-java"">Why does bitwise AND of two short values result in an int value in Java?</a>: </p>

<p>Hence, After going though the <a href=""https://developer.android.com/reference/androidx/work/Constraints"" rel=""noreferrer"">Constraints</a> class I haven't found any function to add time constraint on the work. For like example, I want to start a work to perform at 8:00am (The work can be any of two types <a href=""https://developer.android.com/reference/androidx/work/OneTimeWorkRequest"" rel=""noreferrer"">OneTimeWorkRequest</a> or <a href=""https://developer.android.com/reference/androidx/work/PeriodicWorkRequest"" rel=""noreferrer"">PeriodicWorkRequest</a>) in the morning. How can I add constraint to schedule this work with WorkManager.</p>
","<p>Unfortunately, you cannot schedule a work at specific time as of now. If you have time critical implementation then you should use AlarmManager to set alarm that can fire while in Doze to by using <a href=""https://developer.android.com/reference/android/app/AlarmManager.html#setAndAllowWhileIdle(int,%20long,%20android.app.PendingIntent)"" rel=""noreferrer"">setAndAllowWhileIdle()</a> or <a href=""https://developer.android.com/reference/android/app/AlarmManager.html#setExactAndAllowWhileIdle(int,%20long,%20android.app.PendingIntent)"" rel=""noreferrer"">setExactAndAllowWhileIdle()</a>.</p>

<p>You can schedule a work, with onetime initial delay or execute it periodically, using the <code>WorkManager</code> as follows:</p>

<p><strong>Create Worker class:</strong></p>

<pre><code>public class MyWorker extends Worker {
    @Override
    public Worker.WorkerResult doWork() {

        // Do the work here

        // Indicate success or failure with your return value:
        return WorkerResult.SUCCESS;

        // (Returning RETRY tells WorkManager to try this task again
        // later; FAILURE says not to try again.)
    }
}
</code></pre>

<p><strong>Then schedule <code>OneTimeWorkRequest</code> as follows:</strong></p>

<pre><code>OneTimeWorkRequest mywork=
        new OneTimeWorkRequest.Builder(MyWorker.class)
        .setInitialDelay(&lt;duration&gt;, &lt;TimeUnit&gt;)// Use this when you want to add initial delay or schedule initial work to `OneTimeWorkRequest` e.g. setInitialDelay(2, TimeUnit.HOURS)
        .build();
WorkManager.getInstance().enqueue(mywork);
</code></pre>

<h2><strong>You can setup additional constraints as follows:</strong></h2>

<pre><code>// Create a Constraints that defines when the task should run
Constraints myConstraints = new Constraints.Builder()
    .setRequiresDeviceIdle(true)
    .setRequiresCharging(true)
    // Many other constraints are available, see the
    // Constraints.Builder reference
     .build();
</code></pre>

<p><strong>Then create a OneTimeWorkRequest that uses those constraints</strong></p>

<pre><code>OneTimeWorkRequest mywork=
                new OneTimeWorkRequest.Builder(MyWorker.class)
     .setConstraints(myConstraints)
     .build();
WorkManager.getInstance().enqueue(mywork);
</code></pre>

<h2>PeriodicWorkRequest can be created as follows:</h2>

<pre><code> PeriodicWorkRequest periodicWork = new PeriodicWorkRequest.Builder(MyWorker.class, 12, TimeUnit.HOURS)
                                   .build();
  WorkManager.getInstance().enqueue(periodicWork);
</code></pre>

<p>This creates a PeriodicWorkRequest to run periodically once every 12 hours.</p>

    return result

    if rest:
        _nest_dict_rec(rest[0], v, out.setdefault(k, {}))
    else:
        out[k] = v

flat = {'X_a_one': 10,

<p>""a <strong>static</strong> method that depends only on its parameters and no other data""</p>

<p>Would it not be possible to have an instance method be a pure method without it being static (as long as it doesn't modify parameters and doesn't have 'side-effects' like printing)?</p>

<p>I know for a pure method to be the pure, the return value only depends on the parameters and not on any other state, so perhaps the way instance methods are called means that the variables taken from the object calling the method don't count as parameters but as another ""state""?</p>

<p>Other than that I can't think of any reason why a non-static method couldn't be a pure method. </p>

<p>Here's an example:</p>

<pre><code>public class Rational {

    private int numer;
    private int denom;

    public Rational() {
        this.numer = 0;
        this.denom = 1;
    }

    public Rational(int numer, int denom) {
        this.numer = numer;
        this.denom = denom;
    }
}
</code></pre>

<p>The above defines a <code>Rational</code> class</p>

<p>You could then write a method in the <code>Rational</code> class which returns a <code>Rational</code> object as a <code>double</code> by either 'Method one' or 'Method two' below.</p>

<p>Method one:</p>

<pre><code>public double toDouble() {
    double x = this.numer;
    double y = this.denom;
    double fprat = x / y;
    return fprat;
}   
</code></pre>

<p>Method two:</p>

<pre><code>public static double toDouble(Rational rational)
{
    double x = rational.numer;
    double y = rational.denom;
    double fprat = x / y;
    return fprat;
} 
</code></pre>

<p>They essentially do exactly the same thing but one is a static method and the other is an instance method so their calls would be in a different format. Method two is certainly a pure method but would Method one, which is non-static, also be defined as a pure method under these circumstances?</p>
","<p>A pure method <em>might as well be</em> static. The two criteria for a pure method are, <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pure_function"" rel=""noreferrer"">according to Wikipedia</a>:</p>

<blockquote>
  <ol>
  <li><p>The function always evaluates the same result value given the same
  argument value(s). The <strong>function result value cannot depend on any
  hidden information</strong> or <strong>state that may change while program execution
  proceeds</strong> or between different executions of the program, nor can it
  depend on any external input from I/O devices.</p></li>
  <li><p>Evaluation of the result does not cause any semantically observable
  side effect or output, such as mutation of mutable objects or output
  to I/O devices.</p></li>
  </ol>
</blockquote>

<p>(emphasis mine)</p>

<p>There's no reason why this cannot apply to a non-static method. Making the method static would give a caller stronger guarantees that no instance state was being used, so it's probably better to make it static.</p>

<hr>

<p>Depending on your perspective, one could view an instance method as simply a function taking an extra implicit argument: the instance itself. In this way, a non-static method could rely on instance state and be considered pure, provided it didn't rely on any external state (singletons etc) or produce side effects. <a href=""https://stackoverflow.com/a/50466413/1898563"">Robert's answer puts it nicely</a>. This is up to interpretation, but my person opinion is that such a method would be pure.</p>

<p><a href=""https://stackoverflow.com/users/144746/voo"">Voo</a> put it nicely in the comments:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Why should a hidden this pointer be considered any more special than
  any other parameter to the function? That argument leads to a
  contradiction: Assume that<br>
  <code>public static int pureFunc(MyInstance self)</code>
  is pure, clearly the isomorph<br>
  <code>public int pureFunc()</code> would be pure as
  well.</p>

<pre><code>uint8_t MyArray[10000000];
</code></pre>

<p>when the value at any position in the array is </p>

<ul>
<li><strong>0</strong> or <strong>1</strong> for <em>95%</em> of all cases, </li>
<li><strong>2</strong> in <em>4%</em> of cases,  </li>
<li>between <strong>3</strong> and <strong>255</strong> in
the other <em>1%</em> of cases?</li>
</ul>

<p>So, is there anything better than a <code>uint8_t</code> array to use for this? It should be as quick as possible to loop over the whole array in a random order, and this is very heavy on RAM bandwidth, so when having more than a few threads doing that at the same time for different arrays, currently the whole RAM bandwidth is quickly saturated.</p>

<p>I'm asking since it feels very inefficient to have such a big array (10 MB) when it's actually known that almost all values, apart from 5%, will be either 0 or 1. So when 95% of all values in the array would only actually need 1 bit instead of 8 bit, this would reduce memory usage by almost an order of magnitude. 
It feels like there has to be a more memory efficient solution that would greatly reduce RAM bandwidth required for this, and as a result also be significantly quicker for random access.</p>
","<p>Unless there is pattern to your data it is unlikely that there is any sensible speed or size optimisation, and - assuming you are targetting a normal computer - 10 MB isn't that big a deal anyway.</p>

<p>There are two assumptions in your questions:</p>

<ol>
<li>The data is being poorly stored because you aren't using all the bits</li>
<li>Storing it better would make things faster.</li>
</ol>

<p>I think both of these assumptions are false. In most cases the appropriate way to store data is to store the most natural representation. In your case, this is the one you've gone for: a byte for a number between 0 and 255. Any other representation will be more complex and therefore - all other things being equal - slower and more error prone. To need to divert from this general principle you need a stronger reason than potentially six ""wasted"" bits on 95% of your data.</p>

<p>For your second assumption, it will be true if, and only if, changing the size of the array results in substantially fewer cache misses. Whether this will happen can only be definitively determined by profiling working code, but I think it's highly unlikely to make a substantial difference. Because you will be randomly accessing the array in either case, the processor will struggle to know which bits of data to cache and keep in either case.</p>

<p>Any ideas on what the best way of achieving this is in Flutter?</p>
","<p>Avoid this whenever possible. It makes these widgets depends on each others and can make things harder to maintain in the long term.</p>

<p>What you can do instead, is having both widgets share a common <a href=""https://docs.flutter.io/flutter/foundation/Listenable-class.html"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer""><code>Listenable</code></a> or something similar such as a <a href=""https://docs.flutter.io/flutter/dart-async/Stream-class.html"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer""><code>Stream</code></a>. Then widgets interact with each other by submitting events.</p>

<p>For easier writing, you can also combine <code>Listenable</code>/<code>Stream</code> with respectively <a href=""https://docs.flutter.io/flutter/widgets/ValueListenableBuilder-class.html"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer""><code>ValueListenableBuilder</code></a> and <a href=""https://docs.flutter.io/flutter/widgets/StreamBuilder-class.html"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer""><code>StreamBuilder</code></a> which both do the listening/update part for you.</p>

<p>A quick example with <code>Listenable</code>. </p>

<pre><code>class MyHomePage extends StatelessWidget {
  final number = new ValueNotifier(0);

  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Scaffold(
      body: ValueListenableBuilder&lt;int&gt;(
        valueListenable: number,
        builder: (context, value, child) {
          return Center(
            child: RaisedButton(
              onPressed: () {
                number.value++;
              },
              child: MyWidget(number),
            ),
          );
        },
      ),
    );
  }
}

class MyWidget extends StatelessWidget {
  final ValueListenable&lt;int&gt; number;

  MyWidget(this.number);

  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return new Text(number.value.toString());
  }

<p>It's not really accurate to say that the first is shorthand for the second because method groups predate Lambdas, but if you think in terms of Lambdas when calling LINQ methods like <code>Any</code> then it is effectively the case.</p>

<p>Both seem ok for my use, however, I am inclined towards canvas (as I have already few example working). please correct me <strong>if I am missing anything in d3.js context?</strong></p>
","<p>The differences listed in the linked question/answers speak to the general differences between svg and canvas (vector/raster, etc). However, with d3 these differences have additional implications, especially considering that a core part of d3 is data binding.</p>

<h2>Data Binding</h2>

<p>Perhaps the most central feature of d3 is data binding. Mike Bostock states he needed to create d3 once he joined data to elements:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>The defining moment was when I got the data-join working for the first
  time. It was magic. I wasn’t even sure I understood how it worked, but
  it was a blast to use. I realized there could be a practical tool for
  visualization that didn’t needlessly restrict the types of
  visualizations you could make. <a href=""https://www.reddit.com/r/dataisbeautiful/comments/3k3if4/hi_im_mike_bostock_creator_of_d3js_and_a_former/"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">link</a></p>
</blockquote>

<p>With SVG, data binding is easy - we can assign a datum to an individual svg element and then use that datum to set its attributes/update it/etc. This  is built upon the statefulness of svg - we can re-select a circle and modify it or access its properties. </p>

<p>With Canvas, canvas is stateless, so we can't bind data to shapes within the canvas as the canvas only comprises of pixels. As such we can't select and update elements within the canvas because the canvas doesn't have any elements to select. </p>

<p>Based on the above, we can see that the enter/update/exit cycle (or basic append statements) are needed for svg in idiomatic D3: we need to enter elements to see them and we style them often based on their datum. With canvas, we don't <em>need</em> to enter anything, same with exiting/updating. There are no elements to append in order to see, so we can draw visualizations without the enter/update/exit or the append/insert approaches used in d3 svg visualizations, <em>if we want</em>. </p>

<p><strong>Canvas without data binding</strong></p>

<p>I'll use the example bl.ock in your last question, <a href=""https://bl.ocks.org/mbostock/ad70335eeef6d167bc36fd3c04378048"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">here</a>. Because we don't need to append elements at all (or append data to them), we use a forEach loop to draw each feature (which is counter to idiomatic D3 with SVG). Since there are no elements to update, we have to redraw each feature each tick - redrawing the entire frame (notice the clearing of the canvas each tick). Regarding the drag, d3.drag and d3.force has some functionality anticipating use with canvas, and can allow us to modify the data array directly through drag events - bypassing any need for node elements in the DOM to directly interact with the mouse (d3.force is also modifying the data array directly - but it does this in the <a href=""https://bl.ocks.org/mbostock/4062045"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">svg example</a> as well).</p>

<p>Without data binding we draw elements based on the data directly:</p>

<pre><code>data.forEach(function(d) {
    // drawing instructions:
    context.beginPath()....
})
</code></pre>

<p>If the data changes, we will probably redraw the data.</p>

<p><strong>Canvas with Data Binding</strong></p>

<p>That said, you can implement data binding with canvas, but it requires a different approach using dummy elements. We go through the regular update/exit/enter cycle, but as we are using dummy elements, nothing is rendered. We re-render the canvas whenever we want (it may be continuously if we are using transitions), and draw things based on the dummy elements. </p>

<p>To make a dummy parent container we can use:</p>

<pre><code>// container for dummy elements:
var faux = d3.select(document.createElement(""custom""));
</code></pre>

<p>Then we can make selections as needed, using enter/exit/update/append/remove/transition/etc:</p>

<pre><code>// treat as any other DOM elements:
var bars = faux.selectAll("".bar"").data(data).enter()....
</code></pre>

<p>But as elements in these selections aren't rendered, we need to specify how and when to draw them. Without data binding and Canvas we drew elements based on the data directly, with data binding and Canvas we draw based on the selection/element in the faux DOM:</p>

<pre><code>bars.each(function() {
  var selection = d3.select(this);
  context.beginPath();
  context.fillRect(selection.attr(""x""), selection.attr(""y"")...
  ...
})
</code></pre>

<p>Here we can redraw the elements whenever we exit/enter/update etc which may have some advantages. This also allows D3 transitions by redrawing continuously while transitioning properties on the faux elements.</p>

<p>The below example has a complete enter/exit/update cycle with transitions, demonstrating canvas with data binding:</p>

<p><strong>Summary</strong></p>

<p>With canvas, data binding requires a set of dummy elements, but, once bound you can easily use transitions and the update/enter/exit cycle. But, rendering is detached from update/enter/exit and transitions - it is up to you to decide how and when to redraw the visualization. This drawing takes place outside of the update/enter/exit and transition methods. </p>

<p>With svg, the enter/update/exit cycle and transitions update elements in the visualization, linking rendering and data in one step. </p>

<p>In canvas with data binding on faux elements, the visualization represents the faux nodes. In svg the visualization is the nodes.</p>

<p>Data binding is a fundamental difference, idiomatic D3 requires it in SVG but gives us the choice of whether we want to use it when working with Canvas. 
However there other differences between Canvas and SVG in relation to D3 mentioned below:</p>

<h2>Interactivity</h2>

<p>Perhaps the most substantial concern with using Canvas is that it is stateless, just a collection of pixels rather than elements. This makes mouse events difficult when interacting with specific rendered shapes. While the mouse can interact with the Canvas, standard events are triggered for interactions with specific pixels. </p>

<p>So while with SVG we can assign a click listener (for example) to each node in a force layout, with Canvas, we set one click listener fro the entire canvas and then based on position have to determine what node should be considered ""clicked"".</p>

<p>The D3-force canvas <a href=""https://bl.ocks.org/mbostock/ad70335eeef6d167bc36fd3c04378048"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">example</a> mentioned above uses a force layout's <code>.find</code> method and uses that to find the node closest to a mouse click and then sets the drag subject to that node. </p>

<p>There are a few ways we could determine what rendered shape is being interacted with:</p>

<ol>
<li>Creating a hidden canvas that provides a reference map for rendered shapes</li>
</ol>

<p><em>Each shape in the visible canvas is drawn on the invisible canvas, but on the invisible canvas it has a unique color. Taking the xy of a mouse event on the visible canvas we can use that to get the pixel color at the same xy on the invisible canvas. Since colors are numbers in HTML, we can convert that color to an datum's index.</em></p>

<ol start=""2"">
<li><p>Inverting scales (scaled xy position to unscaled input values) for heatmap/gridded data (<a href=""https://stackoverflow.com/a/51565961/7106086"">example</a>)</p></li>
<li><p>Using an unrendered Voronoi diagram's <code>.find</code> method to find nearest node to event (for points, circles)</p></li>
<li>Using a force layout's <code>.find</code> method to find nearest node to event (for points, circles, mostly in the context of force layouts)</li>
<li>Using straight math, quadtrees, or other methods</li>
</ol>

<p>The first may be the most common, and certainly the most flexible, but the others may be preferable depending on context.</p>

<h2>Performance</h2>

<p>I'll very quickly touch on performance. In the questin's linked post ""<a href=""https://stackoverflow.com/q/4996374/7106086"">What's the difference between SVG and Canvas</a>"" it may not be bold enough in the answers there, but in general canvas and svg differ in rendering time when handling thousands of nodes, especially if rendering thousands of nodes that are being animated. </p>

<p>Canvas becomes increasingly more performant as more nodes are rendered and as the nodes do more things (transition, move, etc).</p>

<p>Here's a quick comparison of Canvas (with data binding on faux nodes) and SVG and 19 200 simultaneous transitions: </p>

<ul>
<li><a href=""https://bl.ocks.org/andrew-reid/31088324b5fafe72b3059e8700c19b8b"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Canvas Test</a> </li>
<li><a href=""https://bl.ocks.org/andrew-reid/e475b756f5dbcdb7f41ebca4a7ed2d06"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">SVG Test</a>. </li>
</ul>

<p>The Canvas should be the smoother of the two.</p>

<h2>D3 Modules</h2>

<p>Lastly I'll touch on D3's modules. Most of these don't interact with the DOM at all and can be used easily for either SVG or Canvas. For example d3-quadtree or d3-time-format aren't SVG or Canvas specific as they don't deal with the DOM or rendering at all. Modules such as d3-hierarchy don't actually render anything either, but provide the information needed to render in either Canvas or SVG.</p>

<p><em>Most</em> modules and methods that provide SVG path data can also be used to generate canvas path method calls, and consequently can be used for either SVG and Canvas relatively easily.</p>

<p>I'll mention a couple modules specifically here: </p>

<p><strong>D3-selection</strong></p>

<p>Obviously this module requires selections, selections require elements. So to use this with Canvas for things like the enter/update/exit cycle or selection .append/remove/lower/raise we want to use faux elements with Canvas. </p>

<p>With Canvas, event listeners assigned with <code>selection.on()</code> can work with or without data binding, the challenges of mouse interactions are noted above.</p>

<p><strong>D3-transition</strong></p>

<p>This module transitions the properties of elements, so it would generally be used with Canvas only if we were using data binding with faux elements.</p>

<p><strong>D3-axis</strong></p>

<p>This module is strictly SVG unless willing to do a fair amount of work to shoehorn it into a Canvas use. This module is extremely useful when working with SVG, especially when transitioning the axis.</p>

<p><strong>D3-path</strong></p>

<p>This takes Canvas path commands and converts them to SVG path data. Useful for taking adopting canvas code to SVG situations. Mostly used internally with D3 to produce SVG path data.</p>

<p>But you can specify a variable <code>is</code> bound to some other type of container that's compatible with its sigil:</p>

<pre><code>my %b is Bag = 1,2,1;
say %b.total
</code></pre>

<p>With this incantation you need to use <code>=</code> because, by the time that operator is encountered <code>%b</code> has already been bound to a <code>Bag</code> and now you need to assign (copy) <strong>into</strong> the <code>Bag</code>.</p>

<p>This way you get the simplicity of just providing a list of values (no explicit keys or <code>Bag</code> coercer/constructor necessary) because <code>=</code> is interpreted according to the needs of the container on its left, and a <code>Bag</code> choses to interpret the RHS of <code>=</code> as a list of keys whose occurrence count is what matters to it.</p>

<p>I'd expect it not to be allowed in the C++ standard because templatization pertains to declaration statements, not to expression statements and in consequence also not to null statements (the statement <code>;</code>).</p>

<p>So, is this a bug in Clang?</p>
","<p>Not really. The standard explicitly disallows such a declaration in <a href=""http://eel.is/c++draft/temp#2"" rel=""noreferrer"">[temp]p2</a>;</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>The <em>declaration</em> in a <em>template-declaration</em> (if any) shall</p>
  
  <ul>
  <li><p>declare or define a function, a class, or a variable, or</p></li>
  <li><p>define a member function, a member class, a member enumeration, or a static data member of a class template or of a class nested within a class template, or</p></li>
  <li><p>define a member template of a class or class template, or</p></li>
  <li><p>be a <em>deduction-guide</em>, or</p></li>
  <li><p>be an <em>alias-declaration</em>.</p></li>
  </ul>
</blockquote>

<p>An <em>empty-declaration</em> doesn't match any of those clauses. Now the standard says that an implementation is required to issue a diagnostic message for any violation of its rules, like this one. Note that it says <em>diagnostic</em>, it doesn't specify whether a warning or an error (or even a note) is issued. The compiler can provide extensions that make what you wrote valid, as it wouldn't change the meaning of a well-formed program.</p>

<p>So no, both are right. However, clang's behavior is due to an extension, not something that the standard specifies.</p>

","<p>You can use <em>patterns</em> as the binding in a <code>for</code> loop, but not <em>refutable</em> patterns. <a href=""https://doc.rust-lang.org/book/second-edition/ch18-02-refutability.html"" rel=""noreferrer"">The difference between refutable and irrefutable patterns is described here</a>, but the gist of it is, if a pattern could fail, you can't use it in a <code>let</code> statement or a <code>for</code> loop. If a pattern <em>can't</em> fail, you can't (currently) use it in <code>if let</code> or <code>while let</code>. (This last may be <a href=""https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/issues/44495"" rel=""noreferrer"">changed in a future version</a> to issue a warning instead of failing.)</p>

<pre><code>let mut numbers = HashMap::new();
numbers.insert(""one"", 1);
numbers.insert(""two"", 2);
numbers.insert(""three"", 3);

for (name, number) in &amp;numbers {
    println!(""{}: {}"", name, number);
}
</code></pre>

<p><code>(name, number)</code> is an irrefutable pattern, because any place where it type checks, it will match. It type checks here because the items being iterated over (defined by the implementation of <a href=""https://doc.rust-lang.org/std/iter/trait.IntoIterator.html"" rel=""noreferrer""><code>IntoIterator</code></a> for <code>&amp;HashMap</code>) are tuples. You could also write the above as</p>

<pre><code>for tuple in &amp;numbers {
    let (name, number) = tuple;
    println!(""{}: {}"", name, number);
}
</code></pre>

<p>because <code>let</code> is another place where only irrefutable patterns are allowed.</p>

  The last two calls are equivalent to

","<p>If you want to integrate it with Stream API, there's not much you can do other than introducing the logging manually. The safest way would be to introduce the logging in the <code>filter()</code> method itself:</p>

<pre><code>List&lt;Person&gt; filtered = persons.stream()
      .filter(p -&gt; {
          if (!""John"".equals(p.getName())) {

              return false;
          }})
      .collect(Collectors.toList());
</code></pre>

<p>Keep in mind that introduction of side-effects to Stream API is shady and you need to be aware of what you're doing.</p>

<hr>

<p>You could also construct a generic wrapper solution:</p>

<pre><code>private static &lt;T&gt; Predicate&lt;T&gt; andLogFilteredOutValues(Predicate&lt;T&gt; predicate) {
    return value -&gt; {
        if (predicate.test(value)) {
            return true;
        } else {
            System.out.println(value);
            return false;
        }
    };
}
</code></pre>

<p>and then simply:</p>

<pre><code>List&lt;Person&gt; persons = Arrays.asList(new Person(""John""), new Person(""Paul""));

List&lt;Person&gt; filtered = persons.stream()
  .filter(andLogFilteredOutValues(p -&gt; !""John"".equals(p.getName())))
  .collect(Collectors.toList());
</code></pre>

<hr>

<pre><code>from sklearn import preprocessing
min_max_scaler = preprocessing.MinMaxScaler()

df = pd.DataFrame({'A':[1,2,3,7,9,15,16,1,5,6,2,4,8,9],'B':[15,12,10,11,8,14,17,20,4,12,4,5,17,19],'C':['Y','Y','Y','Y','N','N','N','Y','N','Y','N','N','Y','Y']})

df[['A','B']] = min_max_scaler.fit_transform(df[['A','B']])
df['C'] = df['C'].apply(lambda x: 0 if x.strip()=='N' else 1)
</code></pre>

<p>After which I will train and test the model (<code>A</code>,<code>B</code> as features, <code>C</code> as Label) and get some accuracy score. Now my doubt is, what happens when I have to predict the label for new set of data. Say,</p>

<pre><code>df = pd.DataFrame({'A':[25,67,24,76,23],'B':[2,54,22,75,19]})
</code></pre>

<p>Because when I normalize the column the values of <code>A</code> and <code>B</code> will be changed according to the new data, not the data which the model will be trained on.
So, now my data after the data preparation step that is as below, will be.</p>

<pre><code>data[['A','B']] = min_max_scaler.fit_transform(data[['A','B']])
</code></pre>

<p>Values of <code>A</code> and <code>B</code> will change with respect to the <code>Max</code> and <code>Min</code> value of <code>df[['A','B']]</code>. The data prep of <code>df[['A','B']]</code> is with respect to <code>Min Max</code> of <code>df[['A','B']]</code>.</p>

<p>How can the data preparation be valid with respect to different numbers relate? I don't understand how the prediction will be correct here. </p>
","<h2>You should fit the <code>MinMaxScaler</code> using the <code>training</code> data and then apply the scaler on the <code>testing</code> data before the prediction.</h2>

<hr>

<p><strong>In summary:</strong> </p>

<ul>
<li>Step 1: fit the <code>scaler</code> on the <code>TRAINING data</code></li>
<li>Step 2: use the <code>scaler</code> to <code>transform the training data</code></li>
<li>Step 3: use the <code>transformed training data</code> to <code>fit the predictive model</code></li>
<li>Step 4: use the <code>scaler</code> to <code>transform the TEST data</code></li>
<li>Step 5: <code>predict</code> using the <code>trained model</code> and the <code>transformed TEST data</code></li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Example using your data:</strong></p>

<pre><code>from sklearn import preprocessing
min_max_scaler = preprocessing.MinMaxScaler()
#training data
df = pd.DataFrame({'A':[1,2,3,7,9,15,16,1,5,6,2,4,8,9],'B':[15,12,10,11,8,14,17,20,4,12,4,5,17,19],'C':['Y','Y','Y','Y','N','N','N','Y','N','Y','N','N','Y','Y']})

#after the model training on the transformed training data define the testing data df_test

database.close();

<p>MSVC2017 identifies this situation as risky, and issues a warning: <code>returning address of local variable or temporary</code>. Empirical testing with clang and other compilers shows this is true across the board. What I do not understand, is why this is different than several method calls which all return the same type.</p>

<p>For example, this works perfectly:</p>

<pre><code>class A {
public:
    const std::string&amp; name() const { return m_name; }
private:
    std::string m_name;
};

class B {
public:
    const std::string&amp; name() const { return m_a.name(); }
private:
    A m_a;
};

//...
B b;
std::cout &lt;&lt; b.name();
</code></pre>

<p>Works as expected, no warnings/errors at compile or runtime.</p>

<p>But with a lambda, it doesn't:</p>

<pre><code>class A {
public:
    const std::string&amp; name() const { return m_name; }
private:
    std::string m_name;
};

//...
using Getter = std::function&lt; const std::string&amp;() &gt;;
A a;
Getter g = [&amp;a] { return a.name(); };
std::cout &lt;&lt; g();
</code></pre>

<p>results in a crash, or at least printing corrupted memory</p>

<p>Can someone point me to some info about why this does not work? I would generally expect it to work the same...</p>
","<p>The return type of your lambda is <em>not</em> a reference. This is the cause of all your problems.</p>

<p>Your lambda returns a copy of the name. You are storing this lambda in a <code>std::function</code> returning a <code>const std::string&amp;</code>, which means that effectively, you will return a reference to that copy which will get destroyed as soon as <code>std::function</code>'s call operator returns!<sup>1</sup></p>

<p>Naturally, the fix is to change the return type of the lambda:</p>

<pre><code>Getter g = [&amp;a]() -&gt; const std::string&amp; { return a.name(); };

// or
Getter g = [&amp;a]() -&gt; auto&amp; { return a.name(); };
// or if you are feeling fancy :P
Getter g = [&amp;a]() -&gt; decltype(auto) { return a.name(); };
</code></pre>

<hr>

<p><sup>1</sup>: To expand a bit on this, you can imagine <code>std::function</code>'s implementation as something like this (only the relevant parts are shown and massively simplified):</p>

<pre><code>template&lt;typename R, typename... Ts&gt;
struct function&lt;R(Ts...)&gt; {
  R operator()(Ts... Args) const {
    return callInternalFunctionObject(Args...); // here: copy will get destructed
  }
};
// R=const std::string&amp;, and Ts is empty

I was wondering why we need to explicitly declare <code>auto</code> if the compiler is able to automatically deduce the type. I know C++ is a strongly typed language and this is a rule but was it not possible to achieve the same outcome without explicitly declaring a variable <code>auto</code>?</p>
","<p>Your question allows two interpretations:</p>

<ul>
<li>Why do we need 'auto' at all? Can't we simply drop it?</li>
<li>Why are we obliged to use auto? Can't we just have it implicit, if it is not given?</li>
</ul>

<p>Bathsheba <a href=""https://stackoverflow.com/a/50483219/1312382"">answered</a> nicely the first interpretation, for the second, consider the following (assuming no other declarations exist so far; <em>hypothetically</em> valid C++):</p>

<pre><code>int f();
double g();

n = f(); // declares a new variable, type is int;
d = g(); // another new variable, type is double

if(n == d)
{
    n = 7; // reassigns n
    auto d = 2.0; // new d, shadowing the outer one
}
</code></pre>

<p>It <em>would</em> be possible, other languages get away quite well with (well, apart from the shadowing issue perhaps)... It is not so in C++, though, and the question (in the sense of the second interpretation) now is: <em>Why?</em></p>

<p>This time, the answer is not as evident as in the first interpretation. One thing is obvious, though: The explicit requirement for the keyword makes the language safer (I do not know if this is what drove the language committee to its decision, still it remains a point):</p>

<pre><code>grummel = f();

// ...

if(true)
{
    brummel = f();
  //^ uh, oh, a typo...
}
</code></pre>

<p>Can we agree on this not needing any further explanations?</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>The even bigger danger in not requiring auto, [however], is that it means that adding a global variable in a place far away from a function (e.g. in a header file) can turn what was intended to be the declaration of a locally-scoped variable in that function into an assignment to the global variable... with potentially disastrous (and certainly very confusing) consequences.</p>

<pre><code>All gms/firebase libraries must use the exact same version specification (mixing versions can lead to runtime crashes). Found versions 15.1.0, 15.0.2, 15.0.1, 15.0.0. Examples include com.google.firebase:firebase-iid:15.1.0 and com.google.android.gms:play-services-measurement-base:15.0.2
</code></pre>

<p>According to <a href=""https://dl.google.com/dl/android/maven2/index.html"" rel=""noreferrer"">Google's Maven Repository</a> the latest version of <code>firebase-messaging</code> is 15.0.2 and I'm getting error for <code>firebase-iid:15.1.0</code>
So I cannot upgrade the <code>firebase-messaging</code> to a higher version or implement the <code>firebase-iid:15.1.0</code> to match the versions.</p>

<p>I've already tried other solutions recommended here: <a href=""https://stackoverflow.com/questions/49106463/all-gms-firebase-libraries-must-use-the-exact-same-version-specification-android"">1</a>, <a href=""https://stackoverflow.com/questions/47398016/android-studio-all-gms-firebase-libaries-must-use-the-exact-same-version"">2</a>, <a href=""https://stackoverflow.com/questions/50100108/all-gms-firebase-libraries-must-use-the-exact-same-version-specification/50100204#50100204"">3</a> but non of them were useful.</p>

<p>I've also tried this (however it doesn't seem to be a proper solution):</p>

<pre><code>implementation ('com.google.firebase:firebase-messaging:15.0.2') {
    exclude group: ""com.google.android.gms""
}
</code></pre>

<p>and I get this error:</p>

<pre><code>Error:Execution failed for task ':app:transformDexArchiveWithExternalLibsDexMergerForBazaarDebug'.
java.lang.RuntimeException: com.android.builder.dexing.DexArchiveMergerException: Unable to merge dex
</code></pre>

<p>Thanks in advance.</p>
","<p>You need to update <code>google-service</code> plugin to use:</p>

<pre><code>classpath 'com.google.gms:google-services:3.3.0'
</code></pre>

<p>to be able to avoid those errors, also upgrade to android studio 3.1</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>If you're not using Android Studio 3.1 to develop your app, you will need to upgrade in order to get the correct version checking behavior within the IDE.</p>

I successfully followed instructions in angular update guide (including the update of <code>angular-cli</code> to v6), and now I am trying to serve the app via</p>

<pre><code>ng serve --env=local
</code></pre>

<p>But this gives me error:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Unknown option: '--env'</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I use multiple environments (<code>dev/local/prod</code>), and this is the way it was working in 5.2. How can I set the environment now in angular 6?</p>
","<p>You need to use the new <code>configuration</code> option (this works for <code>ng build</code> and <code>ng serve</code> as well)</p>

<pre><code>ng serve --configuration=local
</code></pre>

<p>or</p>

<pre><code>ng serve -c local
</code></pre>

<p>If you look at your <code>angular.json</code> file, you'll see that you have finer control over settings for each configuration (aot, optimizer, environment files,...)</p>

<pre><code>""configurations"": {
  ""production"": {
    ""optimization"": true,
    ""outputHashing"": ""all"",
    ""sourceMap"": false,
    ""extractCss"": true,
    ""namedChunks"": false,
    ""aot"": true,
    ""extractLicenses"": true,
    ""vendorChunk"": false,
    ""buildOptimizer"": true,
    ""fileReplacements"": [
      {
        ""replace"": ""src/environments/environment.ts"",
        ""with"": ""src/environments/environment.prod.ts""
      }
    ]
  }
}
</code></pre>

<p>You can get more info <a href=""https://github.com/angular/angular-cli/wiki/stories-application-environments"" rel=""noreferrer"">here</a> for managing environment specific configurations. </p>

<p>As pointed in the other response below, if you need to add a new 'environment', you need to add a new configuration to the <strong>build</strong> task and, depending on your needs, to the <strong>serve</strong> and <strong>test</strong> tasks as well.</p>

<p><strong>Adding a new environment</strong></p>

<p><strong>Edit</strong>:
To make it clear, file replacements must be specified in the <code>build</code> section. So if you want to use <code>ng serve</code> with a specific <code>environment</code> file (say <strong>dev2</strong>), you first need to modify the <code>build</code> section to add a new <strong>dev2</strong> configuration </p>

<pre><code>""build"": {
   ""configurations"": {
        ""dev2"": {

          ""fileReplacements"": [
            {
              ""replace"": ""src/environments/environment.ts"",
              ""with"": ""src/environments/environment.dev2.ts""
            }
            /* You can add all other options here, such as aot, optimization, ... */
          ],
          ""serviceWorker"": true
        },
</code></pre>

<p>Then modify your <code>serve</code> section to add a new configuration as well, pointing to the <strong>dev2</strong> <code>build</code> configuration you just declared</p>

<pre><code>""serve"":
      ""configurations"": {
        ""dev2"": {
          ""browserTarget"": ""projectName:build:dev2""
        }
</code></pre>

<p>Then you can use <code>ng serve -c dev2</code>, which will use the dev2 config file</p>

<pre><code>uint8_t MyArray[10000000];
</code></pre>

<p>when the value at any position in the array is </p>

<ul>
<li><strong>0</strong> or <strong>1</strong> for <em>95%</em> of all cases, </li>
<li><strong>2</strong> in <em>4%</em> of cases,  </li>
<li>between <strong>3</strong> and <strong>255</strong> in
the other <em>1%</em> of cases?</li>
</ul>

<p>So, is there anything better than a <code>uint8_t</code> array to use for this? It should be as quick as possible to loop over the whole array in a random order, and this is very heavy on RAM bandwidth, so when having more than a few threads doing that at the same time for different arrays, currently the whole RAM bandwidth is quickly saturated.</p>

<p>I'm asking since it feels very inefficient to have such a big array (10 MB) when it's actually known that almost all values, apart from 5%, will be either 0 or 1. So when 95% of all values in the array would only actually need 1 bit instead of 8 bit, this would reduce memory usage by almost an order of magnitude. 
It feels like there has to be a more memory efficient solution that would greatly reduce RAM bandwidth required for this, and as a result also be significantly quicker for random access.</p>
","<p>What I've done in the past is use a hashmap in <em>front</em> of a bitset.</p>

<p>This halves the space compared to Matteo's answer, but may be slower if ""exception"" lookups are slow (i.e. there are many exceptions).</p>

<p>However, I'm having a problem with python plots. I have a chunk of python code where I plot multiple figures in python.</p>

<p>When I do that with R, RStudio will display all the plots generated in this chunk side by side inline.</p>

<p>Unfortunately, when doing the same with a chunk of python code, RStudio opens a new Window where it displays the plot, <em>then the code execution is halted until I close that window</em>, then it plots the next figure, I have to close it again, etc etc.</p>

<p>Is there a possibility to force RStudio to put the figures inline, and then continue code execution? Thanks for your help in advance!</p>
","<p>To expand on my earlier comment, I will elaborate with a complete answer. When using <code>matplotlib</code>, the plots are rendered using <em>Qt</em>, which is why you are getting popup windows.</p>

<p>If we use <code>fig.savefig</code> instead of <code>pyplot.show</code> and then <code>pyplot.close</code> we can avoid the popup windows. Here is a minimal example:</p>

<pre><code>---

## Python *pyplot*

```{python pyplot, echo=FALSE}
import matplotlib
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
import numpy as np

t = np.arange(0.0, 2.0, 0.01)
s = 1 + np.sin(2 * np.pi * t)

fig, ax = plt.subplots()
ax.plot(t, s)

ax.set(xlabel='time (s)', ylabel='voltage (mV)',
       title='About as simple as it gets, folks')
ax.grid()

fig.savefig(""pyplot.png"")
plt.close(fig)
```

```{r, echo=FALSE}
knitr::include_graphics(""pyplot.png"")
```
</code></pre>

<p>Which produces the following without any process interruption:</p>

</blockquote>

<h3>Update</h3>

<p>Using the latest preview release mentioned above, updating the chunk to use <code>pyplot.show</code> will now display inline as desired.</p>

<pre><code>```{python pyplot, echo=FALSE}

<h3>For Anaconda users</h3>

<p>If you use <em>Anaconda</em> as your python distribution, you may experience a problem where <em>Qt</em> is not found from RStudio due to problem with missing path/environment variable.</p>

<p>The error will appear similar to:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><em>This application failed to start because it could not find or load the Qt platform plugin ""windows"" in """", Reinstalling the application may fix this problem.</em></p>

<p>A quick fix is to add the following to a python chunk to setup an environment variable.</p>

<pre><code>import os
os.environ['QT_QPA_PLATFORM_PLUGIN_PATH'] = '/path/to/Anaconda3/Library/plugins/platforms'
</code></pre>

<p>Replacing <code>/path/to</code> with the relevant location to your Anaconda distribution.</p>

We need to regularly update other components about that state, and for that we send protobuf-encoded messages via MQTT and other messaging protocols. There are different messages that describe different aspects of the hardware, so we need to send different views of the data of those classes. Here's a sketch:</p>

<pre><code>struct some_data {
  Foo foo;
  Bar bar;
  Baz baz;
  Fbr fbr;
  // ...
};
</code></pre>

<p>Let's assume we need to send one message containing <code>foo</code> and <code>bar</code>, and one containing <code>bar</code> and <code>baz</code>. Our current way of doing this is a lot of boiler-plate:</p>

<pre><code>struct foobar {
  Foo foo;
  Bar bar;
  foobar(const Foo&amp; foo, const Bar&amp; bar) : foo(foo), bar(bar) {}
  bool operator==(const foobar&amp; rhs) const {return foo == rhs.foo &amp;&amp; bar == rhs.bar;}
  bool operator!=(const foobar&amp; rhs) const {return !operator==(*this,rhs);}
};

struct barbaz {
  Bar bar;
  Baz baz;
  foobar(const Bar&amp; bar, const Baz&amp; baz) : bar(bar), baz(baz) {}
  bool operator==(const barbaz&amp; rhs) const {return bar == rhs.bar &amp;&amp; baz == rhs.baz;}
  bool operator!=(const barbaz&amp; rhs) const {return !operator==(*this,rhs);}
};

template&lt;&gt; struct serialization_traits&lt;foobar&gt; {
  static SerializedFooBar encode(const foobar&amp; fb) {
    SerializedFooBar sfb;
    sfb.set_foo(fb.foo);
    sfb.set_bar(fb.bar);
    return sfb;
  }
};

template&lt;&gt; struct serialization_traits&lt;barbaz&gt; {
  static SerializedBarBaz encode(const barbaz&amp; bb) {
    SerializedBarBaz sbb;
    sfb.set_bar(bb.bar);
    sfb.set_baz(bb.baz);
    return sbb;
  }
};
</code></pre>

<p>This can then be sent:</p>

<pre><code>void send(const some_data&amp; data) {
  send_msg( serialization_traits&lt;foobar&gt;::encode(foobar(data.foo, data.bar)) );
  send_msg( serialization_traits&lt;barbaz&gt;::encode(barbaz(data.foo, data.bar)) );
}
</code></pre>

<p>Given that the data sets to be sent are often much larger than two items, that we need to decode that data, too, and that we have tons of these messages, there is a lot more boilerplate involved than what's in this sketch. So I have been searching for a way to reduce this. Here's a first idea: </p>

<pre><code>typedef std::tuple&lt; Foo /* 0 foo */
                  , Bar /* 1 bar */
                  &gt; foobar;
typedef std::tuple&lt; Bar /* 0 bar */
                  , Baz /* 1 baz */
                  &gt; barbaz;
// yay, we get comparison for free!

template&lt;&gt;
struct serialization_traits&lt;foobar&gt; {
  static SerializedFooBar encode(const foobar&amp; fb) {
    SerializedFooBar sfb;
    sfb.set_foo(std::get&lt;0&gt;(fb));
    sfb.set_bar(std::get&lt;1&gt;(fb));
    return sfb;
  }
};

template&lt;&gt;
struct serialization_traits&lt;barbaz&gt; {
  static SerializedBarBaz encode(const barbaz&amp; bb) {
    SerializedBarBaz sbb;
    sfb.set_bar(std::get&lt;0&gt;(bb));
    sfb.set_baz(std::get&lt;1&gt;(bb));
    return sbb;
  }
};

void send(const some_data&amp; data) {
  send_msg( serialization_traits&lt;foobar&gt;::encode(std::tie(data.foo, data.bar)) );
  send_msg( serialization_traits&lt;barbaz&gt;::encode(std::tie(data.bar, data.baz)) );
}
</code></pre>

<p>I got this working, and it cuts the boilerplate considerably. (Not in this small example, but if you imagine a dozen data points being encoded and decoded, a lot of the repeating listings of data members disappearing makes a lot of difference). However, this has two disadvantages: </p>

<ol>
<li><p>This relies on <code>Foo</code>, <code>Bar</code>, and <code>Baz</code> being distinct types. If they are all <code>int</code>, we need to add a dummy tag type to the tuple. </p>

<p>This can be done, but it does make this whole idea considerably less appealing. </p></li>
<li><p>What's variable names in the old code becomes comments and numbers in the new code. That's pretty bad, and given that it is likely that a bug confusing two members is likely present in the encoding as well as in the decoding, it can't be caught in simple unit tests, but needs test components created through other technologies (so integration tests) for catching such bugs. </p>

<p>I have no idea how to fix this.</p></li>
</ol>

<p>Has anybody a better idea how to reduce the boilerplate for us?</p>

<p><em>Note:</em> </p>

<ul>
<li>For the time being, we're stuck with C++03. Yes, you read that right. For us, it's <code>std::tr1::tuple</code>. No lambda. And no <code>auto</code> either.</li>
<li>We have a tons of code employing those serialization traits. We cannot throw away the whole scheme and do something completely different. I am looking for a solution to simplify future code fitting into the existing framework. Any idea that requires us to re-write the whole thing will very likely be dismissed. </li>
</ul>
","<p>In my opinion, the best all-around solution is an external C++ code generator in a scripting language. It has the following advantages:</p>

<ul>
<li><p><strong>Flexibility</strong>: it allows you to change the generated code at any time. This is extremely good for several sub-reasons:</p>

<ul>
<li>Readily fix bugs in all old supported releases.</li>
<li>Use new C++ features if you move to C++11 or later in the future.</li>
<li>Generate code for a different language. This is very, very useful (specially if your organization is big and/or you have many users). For instance, you could output a small scripting library (e.g. Python module) that can be used as a CLI tool to interface with the hardware. In my experience, this was very liked by hardware engineers.</li>
<li>Generate GUI code (or GUI descriptions, e.g. in XML/JSON; or even a web interface) -- useful for people using the final hardware and testers.</li>
<li>Generation of other kind of data. For instance, diagrams, statistics, etc. Or even the protobuf descriptions themselves.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><p><strong>Maintenance</strong>: it will be easier to maintain than in C++. Even if it is written in a different language, it is typically easier to learn that language than have a new C++ developer dive into C++ template metaprogramming (specially in C++03).</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Performance</strong>: it can easily reduce the compilation time of the C++ side (since you can output very simple C++ -- even plain C). Of course, the generator may offset this advantage. In your case, this may not apply, since it looks like you cannot change the client code.</p></li>
</ul>

<p>I have used that approach in a couple of projects/systems and it turned out quite nicely. Specially the different alternatives for using the hardware (C++ lib, Python lib, CLI, GUI...) can be <strong><em>very</em></strong> appreciated.</p>

<hr>

<p>Side note: if part of the generation requires parsing <em>already existing</em> C++ code (e.g. headers with data types to be serialized, like in OP's case with the <code>Serialized</code> types); then a very nice solution is using <a href=""https://clang.llvm.org/docs/Tooling.html"" rel=""noreferrer"">LLVM/clang's tooling</a> to do so.</p>

<p>In a particular project I worked on, we had to serialize dozens of C++ types automatically (that were subject to change at any time by users). We managed to generate automatically the code for it by just using the clang Python bindings and integrate it in the build process. While the Python bindings did not expose all the AST details (at the time, at least), they were enough for generating the required serialization code for all our types (which included templated classes, containers, etc.).</p>

<h2><strong>UPDATE after more thorough testing of the answers</strong></h2>

<p>I just noticed that removing geoms can have an impact on the layout of the other geoms. Probably great as a default and the intended behaviour for most use cases, but I actually need the exact same chart ""layout"" (axis and positions of remaining geoms).</p>

<p>Example, before removing one geom:</p>

<pre><code>library(dplyr)

count(mpg, class) %&gt;%
  mutate(pct=n/sum(n)) %&gt;%
  ggplot(aes(class, pct)) +

<p>after removing one geom (note that the y axis doesn't start at 0 anymore, I guess the default behaviour for line/point without bars):</p>

<pre><code>library(dplyr)
library(ggplot2)
count(mpg, class) %&gt;%
  mutate(pct=n/sum(n)) %&gt;%

I would like to iterate over the first list and get the corresponding object from the second (which has common properties) and then wrap those objects around and finally add that object to a list using Java Streams.</p>

<p>This is the example I have taken.</p>

<pre><code>private class Person {

        public String getName() {
            return name;
        }

        public boolean isSenior() {
            return isSenior;
        }

        @Override
        public String toString() {
            return name + "": "" + isSenior;
        }

    private class PersonWrapper {
        private Person jrPerson;
        private Person srPerson;

        private PersonWrapper(Person jrPerson, Person srPerson) {
            this.jrPerson = jrPerson;
            this.srPerson = srPerson;
        }

        public Person getJrPerson() {
            return jrPerson;
        }

        public Person getSrPerson() {
            return srPerson;

            return jrPerson.toString() + ""-"" + srPerson.toString();
        }
    }
</code></pre>

<p>Now, in the main class, I will create two list instances like this</p>

<pre><code>List&lt;Person&gt; jrPersons = new ArrayList&lt;&gt;();
List&lt;Person&gt; srPersons = new ArrayList&lt;&gt;();
</code></pre>

<p>and add the objects in the following manner</p>

<pre><code>jrList.add(new Person(""John"", false));
jrList.add(new Person(""Paul"", false));
jrList.add(new Person(""Mike"", false));

seniorList.add(new Person(""John"", true));
seniorList.add(new Person(""Paul"", true));
seniorList.add(new Person(""Mike"", true));
</code></pre>

<p>Now, I want to iterate over the jrList and find the corresponding Person object in the srList (same name). Then I would wrap these objects as <code>PersonWrapper</code> and that object to a list.</p>

<p>So far, this is what I have been doing</p>

<pre><code>List&lt;PersonWrapper&gt; wrapperList = new ArrayList&lt;&gt;();

jrList.forEach(jr -&gt; seniorList.stream().filter(sr -&gt; jr.getName().equals(sr.getName())).map(sr -&gt; new PersonWrapper(jr, sr)).collect(Collectors.toList()));
</code></pre>

<p>Now, I would like to know how the <code>Collectors.toList()</code> can be substituted by <code>wrapperList</code> or how the output from <code>Collectors.toList()</code> be added to <code>wrapperList</code>.</p>

<p>Please help me in achieving this.</p>
","<p>Instead of using a <code>forEach</code> just use streams from the beginning:</p>

<pre><code>List&lt;PersonWrapper&gt; wrapperList = jrList.stream()
    .flatMap(jr -&gt; seniorList.stream()
         .filter(sr -&gt; jr.getName().equals(sr.getName()))
         .map(sr -&gt; new PersonWrapper(jr, sr))
    )
    .collect(Collectors.toList());
</code></pre>

<p>By using <code>flatMap</code> you can <em>flatten</em> a stream of streams (<code>Stream&lt;Stream&lt;PersonWrapper&gt;&gt;</code>) into a single stream (<code>Stream&lt;PersonWrapper&gt;</code>)</p>

<p>If you can't instantiate <code>wrapperList</code> by yourself or really need to append to it. You can alter above snippet to following:</p>

<pre><code>List&lt;PersonWrapper&gt; wrapperList = new ArrayList&lt;&gt;();

jrList.stream()
    .flatMap(jr -&gt; seniorList.stream()
         .filter(sr -&gt; jr.getName().equals(sr.getName()))

    .forEach(wrapperList::add);

<p>You can see it here in action: <a href=""https://kc-hrubeho.cz"" rel=""noreferrer"">https://kc-hrubeho.cz</a> (ctrl+F ""Facebook""). Yellow button ""Načíst další"" works as an AJAX pagination. Sorry for the Czech language, this website unfortunately does not have an English version.</p>

<p>I'm using this URL to get JSON object of the page content: <code>https://graph.facebook.com/&lt;PAGE-ID&gt;/feed?access_token=&lt;TOKEN&gt;&amp;limit=10&amp;fields=message,link,attachments,created_time,full_picture,picture,timeline_visibility</code></p>

<p>Right now it <strong>works</strong>, but <a href=""https://developers.facebook.com/docs/apps/review/faqs/#graph-api-3-0"" rel=""noreferrer"">App review FAQ</a> states this:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><em>My app used to access public content on pages, am I affected by the v3.0 changes?</em></p>
  
  <p>Yes. Apps that access content of public pages need to request Page
  Public Content Access feature and require review by Facebook.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Also, there is this notice:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>In order to maintain your current API access, your app will need to be
  submitted for review by August 1, 2018.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I've filled out the form for review. One of the required items is ""the screencast"".</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>We need to see your app using Page Public Content Access so we can see
  that it doesn't violate our policies. Upload a video screencast
  walkthrough using any method, (even recording with your phone). You
  must show:</p>
  
  <ol>
  <li>How a person logs in with Facebook</li>
  <li>How a person sees this feature used in your app</li>
  </ol>
</blockquote>

<p>More detailed instructions about the screencast state this however:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>You do not need to submit your app if it will only be used by you or
  by a reduced number of people. Any account listed in the Roles tab in
  your App Dashboard, such as admins, developers and testers, can access
  all permissions and generate a user or page access token.</p>
  
  <p>You can use any of these accounts to test your app and create a
  screencast.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>This is incredibly confusing. My questions are:</p>

<ol>
<li><p>If my code access the Pages API and shows the result on my website, is it ""used by reduced number of people""? </p></li>
<li><p>If I <em>do not need</em> to create a screencast, how can I apply for a review? Do I even need it (meaning ""will my token work after 1st August"")?</p></li>
<li><p>If I <em>do need</em> a review with a screencast, what exactly should I record in my case? Should I just stitch a few screencasts of my code and the website to a single video? That, imho, sounds just bonkers. :)</p></li>
<li><p>Is there a different endpoint all together (which would not require a review <em>or</em> the screencast) that I should use, if I only need to read the data of my own page?</p></li>
<li><p>My old applications are working right now (not sure about August 1, see above).

<p>Thanks in advance!</p>

<h2>Edit</h2>

<p>This is what I've heard from the group moderator of official FB support group <a href=""https://www.facebook.com/groups/fbdevelopers"" rel=""noreferrer"">Facebook Developer Community</a>:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>You can use an app in dev mode to retrieve the feed for pages you are
  admin of. [...] I don't know if August 1 will change the current
  behavior  or if the current behavior is even the intended behavior.
  [...] Actually I never met a person that was able to predict what will
  happen in 90+ days ... most experts even fail to predict tomorrow's

<p>Very frustrating, but so far the most specific answer I got.</p>
","<blockquote>
  <p>If my code access the Pages API and shows the result on my website, is it ""used by [a] reduced number of people""?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>You are most likely the only consumer of the API in your application. Since it's an AJAX call in the background and not a login based application, the ""reduced number"" situation should apply. </p>

<blockquote>
  <p>If I do not need to create a screencast, how can I apply for a review? Do I even need it (meaning ""will my token work after 1st August"")?</p>

<p>As long as the app developer and page admin roles are shared, switching the app to development mode will ensure it will keep working. </p>

</blockquote>

<p>Using the page feed endpoint (/PAGE_ID/feed), while having a user who both is a developer on the app and has a role on the page should work, as long as the app is in development mode.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>The August 1st deadline is for a specific set of permissions </p>

<ul>
<li>user_friends </li>
<li>user_link </li>
<li>user_gender</li>
<li>user_age_range</li>
</ul>

<p>It should work the same since these aren't needed to show the page posts. </p>

<p>Use a user or page token with manage_pages access, since the app token cannot identify whether you have a role on the page. </p>

<p>Yes, this will mean you will have to implement a way to either refresh the user token or ensure the extended page token doesn't invalidate in the background.</p>

Many people decide to use <code>int</code> types for every possible variable used to represent numbers nay in the range of 0-1.</p>

<p>Why does it hurt so much to use <code>char</code> or <code>short</code> instead?</p>

<p>I think I heard someone saying <code>int</code> is ""more standard"" type of.. type.
What does this mean. My question is does the data type <code>int</code> have any defined advantages over <code>short</code> (or other lesser data types), because of which advantages, people used to almost always resort to <code>int</code>?</p>
","<p>As a general rule, most arithmetic in C is performed using type <code>int</code> (that is, plain <code>int</code>, not <code>short</code> or <code>long</code>).  This is because (a) the definition of C says so, which is related to the fact that (b) that's the way many processors (at least, the ones C's designers had in mind) prefer to work.</p>

<p>So if you try to ""save space"" by using <code>short</code> ints instead, and you write something like</p>

<pre><code>short a = 1, b = 2;
short c = a + b;
</code></pre>

<p>the compiler has to emit code to convert <code>a</code> from <code>short</code> to <code>int</code>, convert <code>b</code> from <code>short</code> to <code>int</code>, do the addition, and convert the sum back to <code>short</code>.  You may have saved a little bit of space on the storage for <code>a</code>, <code>b</code>, and <code>c</code>, but your code is likely to be bigger (and slower).</p>

<p>If you instead write</p>

<pre><code>int a = 1, b = 2;
int c = a + b;
</code></pre>

<p>you spend a little more storage space in <code>a</code>, <code>b</code>, and <code>c</code>, but the code is probably smaller and quicker.</p>

<p>This is somewhat of an oversimplified argument, but it's behind your observation that usage of type <code>short</code> is rare, and plain <code>int</code> is generally recommended.  Basically, since it's the machine's ""natural"" size, it's presumed to be the most straightforward type to do arithmetic in, without extra conversions to and from less-natural types.  It's sort of a ""When in Rome, do as the Romans do"" argument, but it generally <em>does</em> make using plain <code>int</code> advantageous.</p>

<p>If you have <em>lots</em> of not-so-large integers to store, on the other hand (a large array of them, or a large array of structures containing not-so-large integers), the storage savings for the data might be large, and worth it as traded off against the (relatively smaller) increase in the code size, and the potential speed increase.</p>

<p>See also <a href=""https://stackoverflow.com/questions/24371077/when-to-use-short-over-int?noredirect=1&amp;lq=1"">this previous SO question</a> and <a href=""http://c-faq.com/decl/inttypes.html"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">this C FAQ list entry</a>.</p>

<hr>

<p>Addendum: like any optimization problem, if you really care about data space usage, code space usage, and code speed, you'll want to perform careful measurements using your exact machine and processor.  Your processor might not end up requiring any ""extra conversion instructions"" to convert to/from the smaller types, after all, so using them might not be so much of a disadvantage.  But at the same time you can probably confirm that, for isolated variables, using them might not yield any measurable advantage, either.</p>

<hr>

<p>Addendum 2.  Here's a data point.  I experimented with the code</p>

<pre><code>extern short a, b, c;

void f()
{
    c = a + b;
}
</code></pre>

<p>I compiled with two compilers, gcc and clang (compiling for an Intel processor on a Mac).  I then changed <code>short</code> to <code>int</code> and compiled again.  The <code>int</code>-using code was 7 bytes smaller under gcc, and 10 bytes smaller under clang.  Inspection of the assembly language output suggests that the difference was in truncating the result so as to store it in <code>c</code>; fetching <code>short</code> as opposed to <code>int</code> doesn't seem to change the instruction count.</p>

<p>However, I then tried <em>calling</em> the two different versions, and discovered that it made virtually no difference in the run time, even after 10000000000 calls.  So the ""using <code>short</code> might make the code bigger"" part of the answer is confirmed, but maybe not ""and also make it slower"".</p>

<p>Thank you</p>
","<p><strong>If</strong> you have deeply-nested loops like that and you <em>must</em> break out, I believe that <code>goto</code> is the best solution.  Some languages (not C) have a <code>break(N)</code> statement that will break out of more than one loop.  The reason C doesn't have it is that it's even <em>worse</em> than a <code>goto</code>: you have to count the nested loops to figure out what it does, and it's vulnerable to someone coming along later and adding or removing a level of nesting, without noticing that the break count needs to be adjusted.</p>

<p>Yes, <code>gotos</code> are generally frowned upon.  Using a <code>goto</code> here is not a good solution; it's merely the least of several evils.</p>

<p>In most cases, the reason you have to break out of a deeply-nested loop is because you're searching for something, and you've found it.  In that case (and as several other comments and answers have suggested), I prefer to move the nested loop to its own function.  In that case, a <code>return</code> out of the inner loop accomplishes your task very cleanly.</p>

<p>(There are those who say that functions must always return at the end, not from the middle.  Those people would say that the easy break-it-out-to-a-function solution is therefore invalid, and they'd force the use of the same awkward break-out-of-the-inner-loop technique(s) even when the search was split off to its own function.  Personally, I believe those people are wrong, but your mileage may vary.)</p>

<p>If you insist on not using a <code>goto</code>, and if you insist on not using a separate function with an early return, then yes, you can do something like maintaining extra Boolean control variables and testing them redundantly in the control condition of each nested loop, but that's just a nuisance and a mess.  (It's one of the greater evils that I was saying using a simple <code>goto</code> is lesser than.)</p>

","<p>From your code it looks like you are following Angular official guide which is based on Angular 6 and Rxjs 6. There is a breaking change in Rxjs for which you have to import <code>operators</code> and <code>Observable</code> in a different way now . </p>

<p>I want to seed some users and roles. Both users and roles will use the same store (SQLite). I'm using a static class for seeding which it's called from <code>Program</code>.</p>

<p>I can seed users, but not roles, since the above does not seem to inject a <code>RoleManager</code>.</p>

<p>In ASP.NET Core 2.0 the following is used:</p>

<pre><code>services.AddIdentity&lt;IdentityUser, IdentityRole&gt;()
</code></pre>

<p>I'm guessing <code>AddDefaultIdentity</code> is new in 2.1 but the problem is that it does not inject a <code>RoleMnager</code>, so what should I do?</p>
","<p>It seems that finally Microsoft understood that not every application needs roles and separated them.</p>

<p>Notice that <code>AddDefaultIdentity</code> is declared as:</p>

<pre><code>public static IdentityBuilder AddDefaultIdentity&lt;TUser&gt;(this IServiceCollection services) where TUser : class;
</code></pre>

<p>So, you can continue to configure Identity options through that <code>IdentityBuilder</code>. What you want to do is:</p>

<pre><code>services.AddDefaultIdentity&lt;IdentityUser&gt;().AddRoles&lt;IdentityRole&gt;();
</code></pre>

<p>Fortunately, they also removed the <code>IUser</code> and <code>IRole</code> constrains, so now you can use models in a completely separate assembly without having to install hundreds of NuGet packages.</p>

<p>Each of these instructions has it's own opcode in <a href=""http://www.pastraiser.com/cpu/gameboy/gameboy_opcodes.html"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">this table</a>, which makes me think they are of some importance due to the restrictions on the number of possible opcodes.</p>

<p>I first thought that it might be dereferencing a pointer in that register and storing the value at that pointer (<a href=""https://stackoverflow.com/questions/24981252/what-is-the-purpose-of-moving-a-register-to-itself-as-in-mov-eax-eax"">like in this question</a>), but in an <a href=""http://imrannazar.com/content/files/jsgb.z80.js"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">emulator</a>, <code>LD A, A</code> is implemented as:</p>

<pre><code>Z80._r.a = Z80._r.a
</code></pre>

<p>They seem to have no effect on the state of the processor (just set registers to their own value) and take the same number of cycles as a <code>NOP</code> to execute.</p>

<pre><code>4F LD C,A

</code></pre>

<p>You can notice, that the bottom 3 bits are reserved for source register (values 0-7 going <code>B,C,D,E,H,L,(HL),A</code>), 3 bits next to them are target register, again having the same 0-7 meaning (thus 0 vs 0 creates <code>LD B,B</code>), and the top two bits <code>01</code> select the <code>LD</code>, not sure from the quick glance if I deciphered it perfectly.</p>

<p>One would also expect then <code>76</code> to be <code>LD (HL),(HL)</code>, which makes even less sense than <code>LD A,A</code>, so there's special logic to catch that one and do <code>HALT</code> instead.</p>

<p>So it's about simplicity of instruction decoder, using the same bit patterns to select source/target registers, and about not adding more transistors to catch the <code>same,same</code> situations, except the <code>(HL),(HL)</code> (which maybe will internally fail on both source and target requiring memory access, so maybe the extra ""logic"" is fairly simple in the HW design.</p>

<p>Keep in mind the early CPUs were often hand-designed and the amount of total transistors had to be kept low both to fit on the chip, and to be manageable to draw the circuitry by hand and verify its correctness.</p>

<p>EDIT: The Z80 has about 8500 transistors, you may want to check: <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transistor_count"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transistor_count</a> and <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zilog_Z80"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zilog_Z80</a> ... and GameBoy has a bit modified Z80, but the amount of total transistors will be very close-ish to the original value, although I didn't search for exact value, and I'm not sure how far into the future the Nintendo was extending it, maybe they could afford even going for something like 20-50k already, but I doubt it.</p>

<hr>

<p>Addendum: lately I have read about the Russian Sinclair ZX Spectrum clones, which were heavily modified machines, adding extra power, memory and capabilities... And some of them are using these <code>ld same,same</code> opcodes to control DMA transfers, so on these machines code using them as <code>nop</code> would probably fail to execute properly. This is not GameBoy related, but in case you have binary targetting one of the ""Sprinter"" or similar Russian ZX clones, and you find one of these in disassembly, don't consider them automatically <code>nop</code>, they may be part of effective code actually doing something (most probably with DMA).</p>

<p>Did I do something very wrong? I simply expect shuffling sorted and unsorted sequences yields more or less the same distributions of correlations. How small should those correlations be is another story. The same experiment with R's native function <code>sample.int()</code> for permutation yields low correlations in both scenarios.</p>

<p>My experience with <code>Rcpp</code> containers is bad regarding performance in multithreading. I usually create pointers or array of pointers to the beginning elements of <code>Rcpp</code> containers, share these pointers and the containers' sizes among threads. Notice <code>Rcpp::sample()</code> takes and returns <code>Rcpp</code> containers.</p>

<p>Note3: By reading <code>Rcpp</code> source code, the best solution is to program a customized <code>sample()</code> in native C++. The central component of <code>Rcpp::sample()</code> is <code>unif_rand()</code>. Integrate <code>unif_rand()</code> in the modern version of Fisher–Yates Shuffle. Problem solved.</p>

<p>Note4: Using <code>unif_rand()</code> in a multithreaded environment substantially slows down the speed of threads. I do not have time to read the documentation as Dirk Eddelbuettel suggested, but I guess R's source synchronizes <code>unif_rand()</code> someway invisible to us, like <code>malloc()</code> in <code>C</code>. The ultimate solution is to include <code>// [[Rcpp::plugins(""cpp11"")]]</code> and play with <code>std::random</code>.</p>
","<p><a href=""http://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/algorithm/random_shuffle"" rel=""noreferrer""><code>std::random_shuffle(begin, end)</code></a> often uses <a href=""http://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/numeric/random/rand"" rel=""noreferrer""><code>std::rand</code></a>, which is known to be a bad random number generator.

<p>Use <a href=""http://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/algorithm/random_shuffle"" rel=""noreferrer"" title=""Yes, it&#39;s the same link, but cppreference puts them together""><code>std::shuffle</code></a> instead.</p>

  // std::mt19937 is a rather heavy type. As such, it's often recommended

<p>If you want to have a deterministic seed, note that a single <code>int</code> is not enough information to fully seed a <code>std::mt19937</code>, but you could use it anyway:</p>

{
  IntegerVector y(x.begin(), x.end());

  static std::mt19937 engine;

  // Not thread-friendly, but simple.
  // Also, note that you'll get bad results if you seed a mersenne twister
  // (or a lot of RNGs) with 0, so avoid that
  engine.seed(seed);

  std::shuffle(y.begin(), y.end(), engine);

</blockquote>

<p>Programming itself isn't efficient, although it is about making things more efficient. The most enjoyable kind of programming is the highly inefficient, high brainpower, challenging work that improves future efficiency. And, for life to be worth living, I find challenge to be paramount. </p>

<p>Learning new languages. Understanding new libraries. Grokking C++'s template metaprogramming. Rust's borrow checker. Concurrent programming. Even clean, simple Java 8's streams and lambdas. Or bigger: designing the classes of your project. Attempting to simplify the inevitable refactoring due to design errors. Frustration at limitations of your language. These all have something in common for me: they require brainpower. It's inefficient to do these things. I could just go in and code. Granted, that would rapidly devolve into inefficient tar, but that doesn't mean it would be inefficient at the time. It's these challenges, these inefficiencies, that make life worth living.</p>

<p>One of my mentors once said,</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>It's good to be lazy, <em>if</em> it is the right kind of lazy. -- D.A.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I've followed this mentality my whole life. While taking Calculus, I constantly pondered over its rules and quirks. I constantly searched for shortcuts that would make coursework faster. I constantly analyzed the mathematics to try to make sense of it. Consequently, it made so much sense to me. Integration by Parts became easy once I tried to integrate without it and derived it via the Product Rule. Volumes of solids of revolution became easy when I saw that variables were just labels. It didn't matter if I graphed the x axis as the vertical one.</p>

<p>And in programming, it is definitely good to be lazy. Yet, sometimes the laziness never effects increased efficiency in the project I wanted to be lazy with. Sometimes these are only learning experiences which help me become a better developer in the future. And I need it to be enjoyable. As it should be.</p>

<p>As Linus Torvalds said,</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Most good programmers do programming not because they expect to get paid or get adulation by the public, but because it is fun to program.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I would go further:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Life needs to be fun. Whatever you do, you should do not because you expect to get paid, not because you want the approval of others, but because you find it fulfilling. You find it enjoyable. Your life is for you, not for me, but for <em>you</em>.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Perhaps your job isn't enjoyable, but you do it so you can enjoy your free time; that is fine. Perhaps you aren't finding anything enjoyable whatsoever, but you are doing what you know you <em>should</em> find fun. That is also fine. Just remember that life is short; this flash of color will be gone in the blink of an eye. Life is for living. Ensure that you actually are living it, not just surviving.</p>

","<p>According to the Google Maps Platform technical support, a billing account without any credit card information will be created for each project without billing account. This means that the  API calls will still succeed, as long as they fit within the free tier of $200 per month.

The only option after that to reopen billing account is entering the credit card information.</p>

<h3>UPDATE 2018-05-15</h3>

<p>Some messages from the bug</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Have just got off the phone to Google and Huawei. Huawei seem to be
  admitting responsibility. They told me there is an EMUI update due in 1 to
  2 weeks that should fix ""all google maps issues"".</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Also ah...@google.com states</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Google has been able to reproduce the problem on a physical device and is now focusing on addressing the root cause through either a fix or other mitigation.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>It looks like Google and Huawei have to look into this issue together in order to provide a permanent solution.</p>

<h3>UPDATE 2018-05-16</h3>

<p>Google posted the following message in the bug</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>In collaboration with Huawei, Google engineers have identified the root cause of this issue as an unexpected change to the filesystem permissions.  The issue can impact any Android app on a Huawei device which renders a Google map.</p>
  
  <p>Our engineers are preparing a new version of Google Play Services which should resolve the problem.  It will be targeted to devices running Android 7.0 Nougat, or higher.  We will post another update with the status of the rollout.</p>
  
  <p>Thanks for your patience.</p>
</blockquote>

<h3>UPDATE 2018-05-17</h3>

<p>Finally good news from Google</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>We are pleased to report that a beta version of Google Play Services is ready.  We believe this version mitigates the issue on Huawei devices running Android 7.0 Nougat, or higher.  An important caveat is that each time the device is rebooted, you will need to wait about one minute before launching the affected applications.</p>
  
  <p>Starting today at midnight (Pacific Time), the beta will be rolled-out to a segment of the community that has signed-up for the Google Play Services Public Beta Program.  It will ramp to increasing segments of the beta audience over the next few days.  We invite you to join the beta program at <a href=""https://developers.google.com/android/guides/beta-program"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">https://developers.google.com/android/guides/beta-program</a> to obtain an early release of this and future versions of Google Play Services.  Once beta testing is complete it will be rolled out in stages to all users.</p>
</blockquote>

<h3>UPDATE 2018-05-18</h3>

<blockquote>
  <p>As a follow-up to our last update (comment#342), we believe this issue is fixed in Google Play Services version 12.6.85.  If you are still encountering the problem, please ensure your device has this version installed.</p>
  
  <p>As previously noted, there can be a delay (usually less than one minute) between the time the OS is finished booting and Google Play Services starts.  If you launch one of the affected apps during this window, it may not render a map.  If this happens, re-launch the app after a minute or so.  Subsequent launches of the app should succeed every time.</p>
</blockquote>

<h3>FINAL UPDATE 2018-05-22</h3>

<blockquote>
  <p>As of 10:00 AM (PDT) on May 21, 2018, Google Play Services version 12.6.85 was pushed to 100%, following the initial beta rollout.  We believe this resolves the Google Play Services issue on all impacted Huawei devices.</p>
  
  <p>Huawei is working on a longer term solution which is beneficial to its users and developers.</p>
  
  <p>We apologize for this incident and the impact it may have caused.  We are conducting an internal investigation of this issue and will make appropriate improvements to our systems to help prevent future recurrence.  Stay tuned for an Incident Report.</p>

<p>However, there are fewer questions looking at the best way to count <strong>combinations of two or more series</strong>.

<p>Below is some benchmarking for three potential methods. I have two specific questions:</p>

<ol>
<li>Why is <code>grouper</code> more efficient than <code>count</code>? I expected <code>count</code> to be the more efficient, as it is implemented in C. The superior performance of <code>grouper</code> persists even if number of columns is increased from 2 to 4.</li>
<li>Why does <code>value_counter</code> underperform <code>grouper</code> by so much? Is this due to the cost of constructing a list, or series from list?</li>
</ol>

<p>I understand the outputs are different, and this should also inform choice. For example, filtering by count is more efficient with contiguous <code>numpy</code> arrays versus a dictionary comprehension:</p>

<pre><code>x, z = grouper(df), count(df)
%timeit x[x.values &gt; 10]                        # 749µs
%timeit {k: v for k, v in z.items() if v &gt; 10}  # 9.37ms
</code></pre>

<p>However, the focus of my question is on <strong>performance of building comparable results</strong> in a series versus dictionary. My C knowledge is limited, yet I would appreciate any answer which can point to the logic underlying these methods.</p>

<p><sup>1</sup> This is not a typo.</p>
","<p>There's actually a bit of hidden overhead in <code>zip(df.A.values, df.B.values)</code>.  The key here comes down to numpy arrays being stored in memory in a fundamentally different way than Python objects.</p>

<p>A numpy array, such as <code>np.arange(10)</code>, is essentially stored as a contiguous block of memory, and not as individual Python objects. Conversely, a Python list, such as <code>list(range(10))</code>, is stored in memory as pointers to individual Python objects (i.e. integers 0-9).  This difference is the basis for why numpy arrays are smaller in memory than the Python equivalent lists, and why you can perform faster computations on numpy arrays.</p>

<p>So, as <code>Counter</code> is consuming the <code>zip</code>, the associated tuples need to be created as Python objects.  This means that Python needs to extract the tuple values from numpy data and create corresponding Python objects in memory.  There is noticeable overhead to this, which is why you want to be very careful when combining pure Python functions with numpy data.  A basic example of this pitfall that you might commonly see is using the built-in Python <code>sum</code> on a numpy array:  <code>sum(np.arange(10**5))</code> is actually a bit slower than the pure Python <code>sum(range(10**5))</code>, and both of which are of course significantly slower than <code>np.sum(np.arange(10**5))</code>.</p>

<p>See <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YGk09nK_xnM"" rel=""noreferrer"">this video</a> for a more in depth discussion of this topic.</p>

<p>As an example specific to this question, observe the following timings comparing the performance of <code>Counter</code> on zipped numpy arrays vs. the corresponding zipped Python lists.</p>

<pre><code>In [2]: a = np.random.randint(10**4, size=10**6)
   ...: b = np.random.randint(10**4, size=10**6)
   ...: a_list = a.tolist()
   ...: b_list = b.tolist()

In [3]: %timeit Counter(zip(a, b))
455 ms ± 4.7 ms per loop (mean ± std. dev. of 7 runs, 1 loop each)

In [4]: %timeit Counter(zip(a_list, b_list))
334 ms ± 4.2 ms per loop (mean ± std. dev. of 7 runs, 1 loop each)
</code></pre>

<p>The difference between these two timings gives you a reasonable estimate of the overhead discussed earlier.</p>

<p>This isn't quite the end of the story though.  Constructing a <code>groupby</code> object in pandas involves a some overhead too, at least as related to this problem, since there's some <code>groupby</code> metadata that isn't strictly necessary just to get <code>size</code>, whereas <code>Counter</code> does the one singular thing you care about.  Usually this overhead is far less than the overhead associated with <code>Counter</code>, but from some quick experimentation I've found that you can actually get marginally better performance from <code>Counter</code> when the majority of your groups just consist of single elements.</p>

<p>Consider the following timings (using @BallpointBen's <code>sort=False</code> suggestion) that go along the spectrum of few large groups &lt;--> many small groups:</p>

<pre><code>def grouper(df):
    return df.groupby(['A', 'B'], sort=False).size()

def count(df):
    return Counter(zip(df.A.values, df.B.values))

for m, n in [(10, 10**6), (10**3, 10**6), (10**7, 10**6)]:

    df = pd.DataFrame({'A': np.random.randint(0, m, n),
                       'B': np.random.randint(0, m, n)})

    print(m, n)

    %timeit grouper(df)
    %timeit count(df)
</code></pre>

<p>Which gives me the following table:</p>

<pre><code>m       grouper   counter
10      62.9 ms    315 ms
10**3    191 ms    535 ms
10**7    514 ms    459 ms
</code></pre>

<p>Of course, any gains from <code>Counter</code> would be offset by converting back to a <code>Series</code>, if that's what you want as your final object.</p>

<p>No, browsers can cache the files. Common CDN for Blazor apps will do the trick.</p>

<blockquote>

</blockquote>

<p><strong>Blazor</strong> uses web assembly, On paper web assembly should be faster than any js library, however not all browsers have a mature web assembly parser yet. So you might find that browsers will not run web assembly in an optimal speed as of now. </p>

<p>You can create a small blazor app and run it in Firefox, chrome or edge. In most cases Firefox runs blazor apps much faster than chrome or edge, which implies that browser makers still need to improve, even Firefox can improve.</p>

<p>If your app needs to access DOM frequently, then definitely web assembly / Blazor will be slower compared to any JS libraries since web assembly can’t directly access DOM without using Invokes (Which is slow at the moment, please refer my blazer benchmark below).</p>

<p>On Firefox 10,000 <code>RegisteredFunction.InvokeUnmarshalle</code> calls to empty methods takes 250ms while chrome and edge need more than 2400ms in my PC.’ In pure JS it takes below 10 millisonds for the same scenario.</p>

<p><a href=""https://webassemblycode.com/webassembly-cant-access-dom/"" rel=""noreferrer"">https://webassemblycode.com/webassembly-cant-access-dom/</a> </p>

<p>Additionally, current implementation Blazor has its own MSIL engine on top of the browsers web assembly Engine, which means there are two interpreters working to run a Blazor project, Like two translators interpreting a conversation instead on one. Currently Microsoft is working on an AOT compiler, which is not yet release. Once its release Blazor will be much faster than the current implementation.</p>

<p>We can safely assume that the web assembly is the future of web development, but at the moment we can’t say anything about Blazor’s future. On paper Blazor can be faster than any framework out there, however we need commitment from web assembly maintainers, Browser developers, Microsoft and the communities to make the theories practical.</p>

So I tried to protect cout with a mutex.</p>

<p>The following code starts 10 background threads with std::async. When a thread starts, it prints  ""Started thread ..."".
The main thread iterates over the futures of the background threads in the order in which they were created and prints out ""Done thread ..."" when the corresponding thread finished.</p>

<p>The output is synchronized correctly, but after some threads have started and some have finished (see output below), a deadlock occurres. All background threads left and the main thread are waiting for the mutex.</p>

<p>What is the reason for the deadlock?</p>

<p>When the print function is left or one iteration of the for loop ends, the lock_guard should unlock the mutex, so that one of the waiting threads would be able to proceed. </p>

<p>Why are all the threads left starving? </p>

<p><strong>Code</strong></p>

<pre><code>#include &lt;future&gt;
#include &lt;iostream&gt;
#include &lt;vector&gt;

using namespace std;
std::mutex mtx;           // mutex for critical section

int print_start(int i) {
   lock_guard&lt;mutex&gt; g(mtx);
   cout &lt;&lt; ""Started thread"" &lt;&lt; i &lt;&lt; ""("" &lt;&lt; this_thread::get_id() &lt;&lt; "") "" &lt;&lt; endl;
   return i;
}

int main() {
   vector&lt;future&lt;int&gt;&gt; futures;

   for (int i = 0; i &lt; 10; ++i) {
      futures.push_back(async(print_start, i));
   }

   //retrieve and print the value stored in the future
   for (auto &amp;f : futures) {
      lock_guard&lt;mutex&gt; g(mtx);
      cout &lt;&lt; ""Done thread"" &lt;&lt; f.get() &lt;&lt; ""("" &lt;&lt; this_thread::get_id() &lt;&lt; "")"" &lt;&lt; endl;
   }
   cin.get();

Started thread2(6404)
Started thread3(16884)
Done thread0(16024)
Done thread1(16024)
Done thread2(16024)
Done thread3(16024)
</code></pre>
","<p>You lock the mutex and then wait for one of the futures, which in turn requires a lock on the mutex itself. Simple rule: Don't wait with locked mutexes.</p>

<p>BTW: Locking output streams is not very effective, because it can easily be circumvented by code you don't even control. Rather than using those globals, give a stream to code that needs to output something (dependency injection) and then collect the data from that stream in a threadsafe way. Or use a logging library, because that's probably what you wanted to do anyway.</p>

Can this be done in a better way in angular 6?</p>
","<p>I came across the same problem some time ago and want to share a minimal example that works with Angular 2+.</p>

<p>Assume you would like to use following code anywhere in your app:</p>

<pre><code>&lt;app-input-slider [(ngModel)]=""inputSliderValue""&gt;&lt;/app-input-slider&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>1) Now create a component called <code>InputSlider</code>. </p>

<p>2) In the <code>input-slider.component.html</code>, add the following:</p>

<pre><code>&lt;input type=""range"" [(ngModel)]=""value"" (ngModelChange)=""updateChanges()""&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>3) Now we have to do some work in the <code>input-slider.component.ts</code> file:</p>

<pre><code>import {Component, forwardRef, OnInit} from ""@angular/core"";
import {ControlValueAccessor, NG_VALUE_ACCESSOR} from ""@angular/forms"";

@Component({
    selector: ""app-input-slider"",
    templateUrl: ""./input-slider.component.html"",
    styleUrls: [""./input-slider.component.scss""],
    providers: [{
        provide: NG_VALUE_ACCESSOR,
        useExisting: forwardRef(() =&gt; InputSliderComponent),
        multi: true
    }]

})
export class InputSliderComponent implements OnInit, ControlValueAccessor {

    /**
     * Holds the current value of the slider
     */
    value: number = 0;

    /**
     * Invoked when the model has been changed
     */
    onChange: (_: any) =&gt; void = (_: any) =&gt; {};

    /**
     * Invoked when the model has been touched
     */
    onTouched: () =&gt; void = () =&gt; {};

    constructor() {}

    ngOnInit() {}

    /**
     * Method that is invoked on an update of a model.
     */
    updateChanges() {
        this.onChange(this.value);
    }

    ///////////////
    // OVERRIDES //
    ///////////////

    /**
     * Writes a new item to the element.

    writeValue(value: number): void {
        this.value = value;
        this.updateChanges();
    }

    /**
     * Registers a callback function that should be called when the control's value changes in the UI.
     * @param fn

    registerOnChange(fn: any): void {
        this.onChange = fn;
    }

    /**
     * Registers a callback function that should be called when the control receives a blur event.
     * @param fn
     */
    registerOnTouched(fn: any): void {
        this.onTouched = fn;
    }

}
</code></pre>

<p>Of course you could add more functionality and value checks using this class, but I hope it will get you some ideas.</p>

<p><strong>Quick explanation:</strong></p>

<p>The trick is to add the provider <code>NG_VALUE_ACCESSOR on the decorator of the class and implement</code>ControlValueAccessor`. </p>

<p>Then we need to define the functions <code>writeValue</code>, <code>registerOnChange</code> and <code>registerOnTouched</code>. The two latter are directly called on creation of the component. That is why we need to variables (for example <code>onChange</code> and <code>onTouched</code> - but you can name them however you like.</p>

<p>Finally, we need to define a function that lets the component know to update the underlying ngModel. I did that with the function <code>updateChanges</code>. It needs to be invoked whenever the value changes, either from outside (that's why it is called in <code>writeValue</code>), or from inside (that's why it is called from the html <code>ngModelChange</code>).</p>

","<p>The indexer of <code>Range</code> returns a dynamic object, this is the source of your problem. </p>

<p>Moq use <code>Castle Dynamic proxy</code> to generate fake objects, <code>Castle.Proxies.RangeProxy</code> is the generated class in your case. Since this object is not a <code>COM</code> object the processing of those the C# Runtime binder is being called. The Runtime binder resolves the type and looking for the indexer method, but he failed to resolve it because the generated class don't have it.</p>

<p>The easiest way to solve your is to return the indexer result to a strict <code>Range</code> local variable:</p>

<p><a href=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/4QD8s.png"" rel=""noreferrer""><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/4QD8s.png"" alt=""enter image description here""></a></p>

<p>Then your test will fail because <code>range.Rows[1]</code> is equals to <code>row1</code>...</p>

<p>So change your test code to:</p>

<pre><code>[TestMethod]
public void MockRowsTest()
{
    var row1 = MockUtils.MockCells(""test_row_1"", ""test_row_1"");
    var row2 = MockUtils.MockCells(""test_row_2"", ""test_row_2"");
    var range = MockUtils.MockRows(row1, row2);

    Assert.IsNotNull(range);
    Assert.AreEqual(2, range.Count);
    Assert.IsNotNull(range.Rows);
    Assert.AreEqual(2, range.Rows.Count);
    Range x = range.Rows[1];
    Range y = range.Rows[2];
    var xCell = x.Cells[1];
    var yCell = y.Cells[1];
    Assert.AreSame(row1, x); 
    Assert.AreSame(row2, y);
    Assert.AreEqual(""test_row_1"", xCell.Value2);
    Assert.AreEqual(""test_row_2"", yCell.Value2);
}
</code></pre>

<p>The above UT will pass the test. IMO you should to break your aggregation calls to ""atomic OPS(multi line) and methods"" not because it will pass the test, because it will make your code a debug friendly code.(I call that ""the 11TH rule"" where your code will be read a least 10 more times from the time it was written... So let the compiler to remove the transitive local variables and make your it a debug friendly code..).</p>

Every list of <code>A</code> contains positive numbers from <code>{1, 2, ..., n}</code>. The following is an example, where <code>m = 3</code> and <code>n = 4</code>.</p>

<pre><code>A = [[1, 1, 3], [1, 2], [1, 1, 2, 4]]
</code></pre>

<p>I represent every number <code>x</code> in <code>A</code> as a pair <code>(i, j)</code> where <code>A[i][j] = x</code>. I would like to sort the numbers in <code>A</code> in non-decreasing order; breaking ties by lowest first index. That is, if <code>A[i1][j1] == A[i2][j2]</code>, then <code>(i1, j1)</code> comes before <code>(i2, j2)</code> iff <code>i1 &lt;= i2</code>.</p>

<p>In the example, I would like to return the pairs:</p>

<pre><code>(0, 0), (0, 1), (1, 0), (2, 0), (2, 1), (1, 1), (2, 2), (0, 2), (2, 3)

<p>which represents the sorted numbers</p>

<p>What I did is a naive approach that works as follows:</p>

<ul>
<li>First I sort every list in <code>A</code>.</li>
<li>Then I iterate the numbers in <code>{1, 2, ..., n}</code> and the list <code>A</code> and add the pairs. </li>

    for i in range(m):
        for j in range(len(A[i])):
            if A[i][j] == x:
                S.append((i, j))
</code></pre>

<p>I think this approach is not good. Can we do better?</p>
","<p>You could make <em>triplets</em> of <code>(x, i, j)</code>, sort those triplets, then extract the indices <code>(i, j)</code>. That works because the triplets contain all the information needed for the sorting and for inclusion in the final list, in the order needed for the sorting. (This is called the ""Decorate-Sort-Undecorate"" idiom, related to the Schwartzian transform--Hat-tip to @Morgen for the name and generalization and the motivation for me to explain the generality of this technique.) This could be combined into a single statement but I split it up here for clarity.</p>

<pre><code>A = [[1, 1, 3], [1, 2], [1, 1, 2, 4]]

triplets = [(x, i, j) for i, row in enumerate(A) for j, x in enumerate(row)]
pairs = [(i, j) for x, i, j in sorted(triplets)]

</code></pre>

<p>Now, C# 7.3 adds a new feature to constrain a generic type to <code>System.Enum</code>.
I tried using the enum constraint with the <a href=""https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/visualstudio/releasenotes/vs2017-relnotes#csharp"" rel=""noreferrer"">VS2017 15.7 update released today</a>, and it compiles successfully when I write it like this (given I have a <code>using System;</code> directive):</p>

<pre><code>void DoSomething&lt;T&gt;() where T : Enum

<p>However, using the <code>enum</code> keyword does not work and causes the compiler to throw the following errors (there are more errors following, expecting a method body, but not really worth mentioning here I guess):</p>

<p>Since there is a <code>struct</code> constraint working for structures, I do not understand why <code>enum</code> doesn't work here for enums. It's true that <code>enum</code> does not map to an actual type like <code>int</code> would do for <code>Int32</code>, but I thought it should behave the same as the <code>struct</code> constraint.</p>

<p>Did I just fall into an experimental feature trap not being fully implemented yet, or was this done on purpose in the specification (why?)?</p>
","<p>The <code>struct</code> constraint on generics doesn't map to an actual type (though it could, in theory, map to <a href=""https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/system.valuetype(v=vs.110).aspx"" rel=""noreferrer""><code>ValueType</code></a>). Similarly, <code>enum</code> doesn't cleanly map to actual types the way <code>string</code>, <code>int</code>, or <code>long</code> do, it sets up special syntax for creating a class of symbolic constants that map to integer values; hence <code>public enum Stuff</code> instead of <code>public class Stuff : Enum</code>. Note that had the latter been implemented instead, it would be more subtle since it would change syntax based on inherited type, instead of changing syntax based a non-<code>class</code> keyword.</p>

<p>So, in conclusion, yes, <code>where T : enum</code> is not meant to work because <code>enum</code> is a keyword, not a type alias. If you <em>really</em> want to see it work because <code>enum</code> at least smells like a type alias in context like these, go request it!</p>

<p>EDIT: For some historical reference, <a href=""https://stackoverflow.com/questions/79126/create-generic-method-constraining-t-to-an-enum"">here's a question from 2008</a> indicating that <code>Enum</code> was not a valid constraint, since it's a special class.</p>

<pre><code>my $a = 42;
my $b := $a;
$b := 42;       # No exception generated

my \c := $a;
c := 42;        # OUTPUT: «Cannot use bind operator with this left-hand side␤»
</code></pre>

<p>Is this by design?  If so, is there a purpose or benefit to prohibiting sigilless variables from rebinding when <code>$</code> sigiled variables are not prohibited from doing so? </p>
","<p>Yes, it's certainly by design, and - like most things in Perl (6) design - it's this way for more than one reason.</p>

<p>Before discussing the sigilless symbol syntax, it's worth taking a moment to recall some of the roles sigils play in the language. These include:</p>

<ul>
<li>Syntactic disambiguation (you can call a variable whatever you want, even if there happens to be a keyword with that name)</li>
<li>Readability (the data in the program stands out thanks to the sigil)</li>
<li>Defining assignment semantics (in Perl 6 assignment means ""copy in to"", thus <code>my @a = @b</code> means iterate <code>@b</code> and put each thing in it into <code>@a</code>, thus any future assignments to <code>@b</code> will not affect <code>@a</code>)</li>
<li>Restricting what can be bound there (only <code>Positional</code> things to <code>@</code>, for example)</li>
<li>In the case of the <code>$</code>, controlling what will be considered a single item</li>
<li>In the case of <code>@</code> on a signature parameter, causing an incoming <code>Seq</code> to be cached</li>
</ul>

<p>Each sigil, therefore, carries a set of useful default behaviors for data that is to be considered a single item (<code>$</code>), something to index in to positionally (<code>@</code>), something to index in to with a key (<code>%</code>), and something that can be called (<code>&amp;</code>). Each of these, both in the context of assignment, low-level binding, and signature binding, carry generally desirable semantics for that kind of data.</p>

<p>This is fine and well until one wants to write code that is polymorphic over all of these behaviors, or to not commit to any of the sigil behaviors. Earlier iterations of the Perl 6 language design had something like <code>sub foo($x is parcel) { }</code>, where the <code>is parcel</code> thing effectively meant ""don't impose any kind of sigil-y semantics on this"", except that was rather confusing, because the thing had the <code>$</code> sigil but was opted out of the semantics. It was realized that if the sigil behaviors weren't to apply, then it'd be rather better if it looked different (the ""different things should look different"" design principle, which also shows up repeatedly in Perl). The most obvious way to look different was...to not have the sigil.</p>

<p>However, for syntactic reasons, something was needed in the signature to disamgbiguate the name being introduced from a type (since a signature like <code>(Foo)</code> to match on the type <code>Foo</code> but ignore the value was already supported, and useful, and we didn't want to lose that). The <code>\</code> was picked to play that role, getting <code>sub foo(\x) { }</code>, which then allowed the use of <code>x</code> inside of the subroutine.</p>

<p>My recollection is that allowing this form in the case of <code>my</code> came a bit later on, though I'm not entirely sure about that. One of the important things about a sigilless symbol not committing to a behavior is that it also doesn't commit to an <em>assignment</em> behavior, thus an <code>=</code> on it is a little more late-bound (where possible the compiler considers the sigil, and emits quite different code for <code>$</code>/<code>&amp;</code> and <code>@</code>/<code>%</code> assignments). Of course, if the symbol is bound to a value, then no assignment is possible.</p>

<p>That leaves the question of binding behavior. It was decided to make the sigilless symbol form a ""static single assignment"" syntax, as explained in one of the other answers. There were various reasons for this, including:</p>

<ul>
<li>Helping to preserve the ""data stands out"" readability property of sigils, by at least making sure that anything that is to be (immediately) mutable still does carry a sigil</li>
<li>Also enhancing program readability by having a form that lets the reader know that the symbol will never be rebound to a new value, so one can effectively consider it constant within the scope. This is consistent with it being easy to declare real <code>constant</code>s without a sigil.</li>
<li>Gently encouraging a more functional style (perhaps by making those who decide they hate sigils pay the rest of us back with code that's at least more readable in a different way than the sigils offer :-))</li>
</ul>

<p>Finally, I'll note that I find the term ""sigilless variable"" a bit misleading, because there's nothing variable about it whatsoever. It's a syntax for introducing a symbol that is initialized bound to a particular thing and always will be for the (lexical) lifetime of that symbol. The best way of thinking about them is probably to consider them distinct from variables - which imply storage - and instead just consider them a way to attach a name to a value.</p>

<ul>
<li><p>If you're implementing authentication, you'll probably want to log your users' account activity, either by maintaining some data about login/logout events or at least including some sort of ""last login"" field on the account's record. Modifying that data <em>would</em> be a side effect.</p></li>
<li><p>A convention has evolved that treats any operations that result from user actions as Mutations, regardless of side-effects. You see this with <code>react-apollo</code>, for example, where Query components fire the associated query on mount, while Mutation components simply expose a function that can be called to fire that query. If you're planning on using Apollo client-side, it's worthwhile to consider those sort of client features when designing your schema.</p></li>
<li><p>Mutations are ran sequentially, while queries are ran simultaneously. That means it'd be foreseeable to fire a login mutation and one or more other mutations after it within the same call, allowing you to utilize an authenticated context for the subsequent calls. The same could not be said for queries -- if <code>login</code> is a query and you include other queries with it in the same operation, they will all begin resolving at the same time.</p></li>
</ul>

<p>Outside of how they're executed (sequentially vs simultaneously), on the server-side, queries and mutations are effectively interchangeable. You could have queries with side-effects and mutations with no side effects. You probably should stick with conventions, but I think sometimes there's valid reasons where you may have to throw those conventions out the window.</p>

<pre><code>par(mfrow = c(2, 1))
n = 1:5
barplot(-2:2, width = n, space = .2)

barplot(matrix(-10:9, nrow = 4L, ncol = 5L), beside = TRUE,

<p>I've been staring at the definition of the <code>space</code> and <code>width</code> arguments to <code>barplot</code> (from <code>?barplot</code>) for a while and I really expected the above to work (but clearly it didn't):</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><code>width</code>   -- optional vector of bar widths. Re-cycled to length the number of bars drawn. Specifying a single value will have no visible effect...</p>
  
  <p><code>space</code>   -- the amount of space (as a fraction of the average bar width) left before each bar. May be given as a single number or one number per bar. If <code>height</code> is a matrix and <code>beside</code> is <code>TRUE</code>, <code>space</code> may be specified by two numbers, where the first is the space between bars in the same group, and the second the space between the groups. If not given explicitly, it defaults to <code>c(0,1)</code> if <code>height</code> is a matrix and <code>beside</code> is <code>TRUE</code>, and to <code>0.2</code> otherwise.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>As I read it, this means we should be able to match the group widths in the top plot by dividing each group into 4 (hence <code>n/4</code>). For <code>space</code>, since we're dividing each bar's width by 4, the average width will as well; hence we should multiply the fraction by 4 to compensate for this (hence <code>space = c(0, 4*.2)</code>).</p>

<p>However it appears this is being ignored. In fact, it seems all the boxes have the same width! In tinkering around, I've only been able to get the relative <em>within-group</em> widths to vary.</p>

<p>Will it be possible to accomplish what I've got in mind with <code>barplot</code>? If not, can someone say how to do this in e.g. <code>ggplot2</code>?</p>
","<p>It is possible to do this with base plot as well, but it helps to pass the matrix as a vector for the second plot. Subsequently, you need to realize the space argument is a fraction of the average bar width. I did it as follows:</p>

widthsbarplot1 &lt;- 1:5
spacesbarplot1 &lt;- c(0, rep(.2, 4))

  <p>What are the key differences between those two? </p>
</blockquote>

<p>The <code>*Vector</code> and <code>*Matrix</code> classes in <em>Rcpp</em> act as wrappers for <em>R</em>'s <em>SEXP</em> representation, e.g. an <em>S</em> expression that is as a pointer to the data. For details, please see <a href=""https://cran.r-project.org/doc/manuals/r-release/R-ints.html#SEXPs"" rel=""noreferrer"">Section 1.1 SEXPs</a> of <a href=""https://cran.r-project.org/doc/manuals/r-release/R-ints.html"" rel=""noreferrer"">R Internals</a>.<em>Rcpp</em>'s design leverages this by constructing <em>C++</em> objects from classes that enclose the pointer to the data.  This promotes two key features:</p>

<ol>
<li>Seamless transference between <em>R</em> and <em>C++</em> objects, and </li>
<li><em>Low</em> transference cost between <em>R</em> and <em>C++</em> as only a pointer is passed.

<ul>
<li>as the data isn't <em>copied</em> but <em>referenced</em></li>
</ul></li>
</ol>

<p>Meanwhile, <code>arma</code> objects are akin to a traditional <code>std::vector&lt;T&gt;</code> in the way that a <em>deep</em> copy occurs between the <em>R</em> and <em>C++</em> objects. There is one exception to this statement, the presence of the <a href=""http://arma.sourceforge.net/docs.html#Col"" rel=""noreferrer"">advanced constructor</a>, which allows for the memory behind the <em>R</em> object to be <strong>reused</strong> inside of an <code>armadillo</code> object's structure. Thus, if you are not careful, you may incur an unnecessary penalty during the transition from <em>R</em> to <em>C++</em> and vice versa. </p>

<p><strong>Note:</strong> The advanced constructor that allows the reuse of memory does <em>not</em> exist for <a href=""http://arma.sourceforge.net/docs.html#SpMat"" rel=""noreferrer""><code>arma::sp_mat</code></a>. Thus, using references with sparse matrices will likely <em>not</em> yield the desired speed up as a copy is performed from <em>R</em> to <em>C++</em> and back.</p>

<p>You can view the differences based largely on the ""pass-by-reference"" or ""pass-by-copy"" paradigm. To understand the difference outside of code, consider the following GIF by <a href=""http://www.mathwarehouse.com/programming/passing-by-value-vs-by-reference-visual-explanation.php"" rel=""noreferrer"">mathwarehouse</a>:</p>

<p><img src=""https://www.mathwarehouse.com/programming/images/pass-by-reference-vs-pass-by-value-animation.gif"" alt=""""></p>

<p>To illustrate this scenario in code, consider the following three functions:</p>

<pre><code>#include &lt;RcppArmadillo.h&gt;

// [[Rcpp::depends(RcppArmadillo)]]

// [[Rcpp::export]]
void memory_reference_double_ex(arma::vec&amp; x, double value) {
    x.fill(value);
}

// [[Rcpp::export]]
void memory_reference_int_ex(arma::ivec&amp; x, int value) {
    x.fill(value);
}

// [[Rcpp::export]]
arma::vec memory_copy_ex(arma::vec x, int value) {
    x.fill(value);
    return x;
}
</code></pre>

<p>The two functions <code>memory_reference_double_ex()</code> and <code>memory_reference_int_ex()</code> will update the object <em>inside</em> of <em>R</em> assuming the appropriate <em>data type</em> is present. As a result, we are able to avoid returning a value by specifying <code>void</code> in their definitions since the memory allocated by <code>x</code> is being <em>reused</em>. The third function, <code>memory_copy_ex()</code> requires a return type since it passes-by-copy and, thus, does <em>not</em> modify the existing storage without a reassignment call.</p>

<p>To emphasize:</p>

<ol>
<li>The <code>x</code> vector will be passed into <em>C++</em> by reference, e.g. <code>&amp;</code> on the end of <code>arma::vec&amp;</code> or <code>arma::ivec&amp;</code>, and</li>
<li>The class of <code>x</code> in <em>R</em> is either <code>double</code> or <code>integer</code> meaning we are matching the underlying type of <a href=""http://arma.sourceforge.net/docs.html#Col"" rel=""noreferrer""><code>arma::vec</code></a>, e.g <code>Col&lt;double&gt;</code>, or <a href=""http://arma.sourceforge.net/docs.html#Col"" rel=""noreferrer""><code>arma::ivec</code></a>, e.g. <code>Col&lt;int&gt;</code>.</li>
</ol>

<p>Let's quickly take a look at two examples.</p>

<p>Within the first example, we will look at the results from running <code>memory_reference_double_ex()</code> and compare it to the results generated by  <code>memory_copy_ex()</code>. Note, the types between the objected defined in <em>R</em> and <em>C++</em> are the same (e.g. <code>double</code>). In the next example, this will <em>not</em> hold.</p>

<pre><code>x = c(0.1, 2.3, 4.8, 9.1)
typeof(x)
# [1] ""double""

x
# [1] 0.1 2.3 4.8 9.1

# Nothing is returned...
memory_reference_double_ex(x, value = 9)

x
# [1] 9 9 9 9

a = memory_copy_ex(x, value = 3)

x
# [1] 9 9 9 9

a
#      [,1]
# [1,]    3
# [2,]    3
# [3,]    3
# [4,]    3
</code></pre>

<p>Now, what happens if the underlying type of the <em>R</em> object is an <code>integer</code> instead of a <code>double</code>?</p>

<pre><code>x = c(1L, 2L, 3L, 4L)
typeof(x)
# [1] ""integer""

x
# [1] 1 2 3 4

# Return nothing...
memory_reference_double_ex(x, value = 9)

x
# [1] 1 2 3 4
</code></pre>

<p>What happened? Why didn't <code>x</code> get updated? Well, behind the scenes <em>Rcpp</em> created a new memory allocation that was the proper type -- <code>double</code> and not <code>int</code> -- before passing it onto <code>armadillo</code>. This caused the reference ""linkage"" between the two objects to differ. </p>

<p>If we change to using an integer data type in the <code>armadillo</code> vector, notice we now have the same effect given previously:</p>

<pre><code>memory_reference_int_ex(x, value = 3)

x
# [1] 3 3 3 3
</code></pre>

<p>This leads to discussion on the usefulness of these two paradigms. As <em>speed</em> is the preferred benchmark when working with <em>C++</em>, let's view this in terms of a benchmark. </p>

<p>Consider the following two functions:</p>

<pre><code>#include &lt;RcppArmadillo.h&gt;

// [[Rcpp::depends(RcppArmadillo)]]

// [[Rcpp::export]]
void copy_double_ex(arma::vec x, double value) {
    x.fill(value);
}

// [[Rcpp::export]]
void reference_double_ex(arma::vec&amp; x, double value) {
    x.fill(value);
}
</code></pre>

<p>Running a microbenchmark over them yields:</p>

<pre><code># install.packages(""microbenchmark"")
library(""microbenchmark"")

x = rep(1, 1e8)

micro_timings = microbenchmark(copy_double_ex(x, value = 9.0),

<p><em>Note:</em> The referenced object is ~ 6.509771 times faster per iteration than the copied paradigm as we do <em>not</em> have to reallocate and fill that memory. </p>

<blockquote>
  <p>When to use which? </p>
</blockquote>

<p>What do you <em>need</em> to do? </p>

<p>Are you just trying to quickly speed up an algorithm that relies on a loop but lacks the need for rigorous linear algebra manipulation?</p>

<p>If so, just using <em>Rcpp</em> should suffice. </p>

<p>Are you trying to perform linear algebra manipulations? 
Or are you hoping to use this code across multiple libraries or computational platforms (e.g. MATLAB, Python, R, ...)?</p>

<p>If so, you should be writing the crux of the algorithm in <em>armadillo</em> and setting up the appropriate hooks to export the functions into <em>R</em> with <em>Rcpp</em>.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Is there a performance/memory advantage of using one over the other? </p>
</blockquote>

<p>Yes, as indicated previously, there is <em>definitely</em> a performance / memory advantage. Not only that, but by using <em>RcppArmadillo</em> you are effectively adding an additional library ontop of <em>Rcpp</em> and, thus, increasing the overall installation footprint, compile time, and system requirements (see the woes of macOS builds). Figure out <em>what</em> is required by your project and then opt for that structure.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Are the only difference the member functions? </p>
</blockquote>

<p>Not only member functions, but:</p>

<ul>
<li>estimation routines in terms of matrix decomposition</li>
<li>computing statistical quantity values </li>
<li>object generation</li>
<li>sparse representation (avoid manipulating an S4 object)</li>
</ul>

<p>These are <em>fundamental</em> differences between <em>Rcpp</em> and <em>armadillo</em>. One is meant to facilitate transference of <em>R</em> objects into <em>C++</em> whereas the other is meant for more rigorous linear algebra computations. This should be largely evident as <em>Rcpp</em> does <strong>not</strong> implement any matrix multiplication logic whereas <code>armadillo</code> uses the system's Basic Linear Algebra Subprograms (BLAS) to perform the computation.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>And, as a bonus question: should I even consider arma::colvec or arma::rowvec?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Depends on how you want the result to be returned. Do you want to have an: <code>1 x N</code> (row vector) or <code>N x 1</code> (column vector)? <code>RcppArmadillo</code> by default returns these structures as <em>matrix</em> objects with their appropriate dimensions and <em>not</em> a traditional 1D <em>R</em> vector.</p>

<p>As an example:</p>

<pre><code>#include &lt;RcppArmadillo.h&gt;

// [[Rcpp::depends(RcppArmadillo)]]

// [[Rcpp::export]]
arma::vec col_example(int n) {
    arma::vec x = arma::randu&lt;arma::vec&gt;(n);
    return x;

<p>So I switched to using a (so-called) more uniform generator presented in many answers on other questions. Which looks like this</p>

<pre><code>double rnd(const double &amp; min, const double &amp; max) {
    static thread_local mt19937* generator = nullptr;
    if (!generator) generator = new mt19937(clock() + omp_get_thread_num());
    uniform_real_distribution&lt;double&gt; distribution(min, max);
    return fabs(distribution(*generator));
}
</code></pre>

<p>But I saw many scientific errors in my original problem which I was simulating. Problems which were both against the results from <code>rand()</code> and also against common sense.</p>

<p>So I wrote a code to generate 500k random numbers with this function, calculate their average and do this for 200 times and plot the results.</p>

<pre><code>double SUM=0;
for(r=0; r&lt;=10; r+=0.05){   
    #pragma omp parallel for ordered schedule(static)
    for(w=1; w&lt;=500000; w++){   
        double a;
        a=rnd(0,1);
        SUM=SUM+a;
    } 
    SUM=SUM/w_max;
    ft&lt;&lt;r&lt;&lt;'\t'&lt;&lt;SUM&lt;&lt;'\n';
    SUM=0;
}   
</code></pre>

<p>We know if instead of 500k I could do it for infinite times it should be a simple line with value 0.5. But with 500k we will have fluctuations around 0.5.</p>

<p>When running the code with a single thread, the result is acceptable:</p>

<p><a href=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/7lgoG.jpg"" rel=""noreferrer""><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/7lgoG.jpg"" alt=""enter image description here""></a></p>

<p>But here is the result with 2 threads:</p>

<p><a href=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/CItip.jpg"" rel=""noreferrer""><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/CItip.jpg"" alt=""enter image description here""></a></p>

<p>3 threads:</p>

<p><a href=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/nbpB4.jpg"" rel=""noreferrer""><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/nbpB4.jpg"" alt=""enter image description here""></a></p>

<p>4 threads:</p>

<p><a href=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/oRry5.jpg"" rel=""noreferrer""><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/oRry5.jpg"" alt=""enter image description here""></a></p>

<p>I do not have my 8 threaded CPU right now but the results were even worth there.</p>

<p>As you can see, They are both not uniform and very fluctuated around their average.</p>

<p>So is this pseudo-random generator thread-unsafe too?</p>

<p>Or am I making a mistake somewhere?</p>
","<p>There are three observations about your test output I would make:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>It has much stronger variance than a good random source's average should provide. You observed this yourself by comparing to the single thread results.</p></li>
<li><p>The calculated average decreases with thread count and never reaches the original 0.5 (i.e. it's not just higher variance but also changed mean).</p></li>
<li><p>There is a temporal relation in the data, particularly visible in the 4 thread case.</p></li>
</ul>

<p>All this is explained by the race condition present in your code: You assign to <code>SUM</code> from multiple threads. Incrementing a double is not an atomic operation (even on x86, where you'll probably get atomic reads and writes on registers). Two threads may read the current value (e.g. 10), increment it (e.g. both add 0.5) and then write the value back to memory. Now you have two threads writing a 10.5 instead of the correct 11.</p>

<p>The more threads try to write to <code>SUM</code> concurrently (without synchronization), the more of their changes are lost. This explains all observations:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>How hard the threads race each other in each individual run determines how many results are lost, and this can vary from run to run.</p></li>
<li><p>The average is lower with more races (for example more threads) because more results are lost. You can never exceeed the statistical 0.5 average because you only ever lose writes.</p></li>
<li><p>As the threads and scheduler ""settle in"", the variance is reduced. This is a similar reason to why you should ""warm up"" your tests when benchmarking.</p></li>
</ul>

<p>Needless to say, this is undefined behavior. It just shows benign behavior on x86 CPUs, but this is not something the C++ standard guarantees you. For all you know, the individual bytes of a double might be written to by different threads at the same time resulting in complete garbage.</p>

<p>The proper solution would be adding the doubles thread-locally and then (with synchronization) adding them together in the end. OMP has reduction clauses for this specific purpose.</p>

<p>For integral types, you could use <code>std::atomic&lt;IntegralType&gt;::fetch_add()</code>. <code>std::atomic&lt;double&gt;</code> exists but (before C++20) the mentioned function (and others) are only available for integral types.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>In most cases, a dot may be placed before a postfix or postcircumfix:</p>
</blockquote>

<pre><code>my @a;
@a[1, 2, 3];
@a.[1, 2, 3]; # Same
</code></pre>

<blockquote>
  <p>Technically, not a real operator; it's syntax special-cased in the compiler.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I tried myself:</p>

<pre><code>&gt; my @a = 1,2,3,4,5
&gt; @a[1]  # 2
&gt; @a.[1] # 2

&gt; my %a = Perl =&gt; 6, Python =&gt; 3, PHP =&gt; 7
&gt; %a&lt;Perl&gt;  #6
&gt; %a.&lt;Perl&gt; #6

&gt; my @weekdays = ['Monday', 'Tuesday', 'Wednesday', 'Thursday', 'Friday', 'Saturday', 'Sunday'];
&gt; @weekdays.antipairs.hash{'Sunday'}  # 6, I expected it to be syntax wrong, but it did work!
&gt; @weekdays.antipairs.hash.{'Sunday'} # 6, seems visual clarity or brevity
</code></pre>

<p>So, what does the dot before a postfix or postcircumfix in Perl 6 mean? How on earth did it do that? I'm curious about that. Thanks.</p>
","<p>An expression in Perl 6 is parsed as <code>termish</code> things with <code>infixish</code> things between them. A <code>termish</code> is in turn defined as zero or more <code>prefixish</code> things, followed by the term itself, followed by zero or more <code>postfixish</code> things. The <code>postfixish</code> takes in all of:</p>

<ul>
<li>Method calls ( like <code>.foo</code>)</li>
<li>Postfix operators (like <code>++</code>)</li>
<li>Postcircumfix operators (like the <code>[42]</code> in <code>@a[42]</code>)</li>
<li>Doing hyper (<code>&gt;&gt;</code>) on these to distribute them across a data structure</li>
</ul>

<p>Since it just looks for zero or more of them, then you can freely interleave method calls and hash and array indexes. This explains why <code>@weekdays.antipairs.hash{'Sunday'}</code> parses fine (and why <code>@weekdays.antipairs.hash&lt;Sunday&gt;</code> would also work, and even <code>@weekdays.antipairs.hash&lt;Sunday&gt;.say</code> is fine too).</p>

<p>As for the <code>.</code>, the grammar simply accepts and ignores a <code>.</code> before a <code>postfix</code> or a <code>postcircumfix</code>. Here's a slightly cut-down version of the parser, that I've annotated a bit to explain what the pieces are.</p>

<pre><code>token postfixish {
    &lt;!stdstopper&gt;

    # If we're not in a string interpolation, allow unspace (that's
    # where you write `\      ++`, for example, allowing spreading
    # postfixish things over multiple lines).
    [ &lt;!{ $*QSIGIL }&gt; [ &lt;.unsp&gt; | '\\' ] ]?

    # Here we match the &gt;&gt; for doing a hyper. Note that it accepts
    # but disregards a '.' before it. It's not captured at all and
    # doesn't affect the code that is compiled.
    [ ['.' &lt;.unsp&gt;?]? &lt;postfix_prefix_meta_operator&gt; &lt;.unsp&gt;?]**0..1

    [
    | &lt;OPER=postfix&gt;
    # When there'd be no confusion with a method call, a '.' is
    # also accepted and disregarded before a postfix operator
    | '.' &lt;?before \W&gt; &lt;OPER=postfix&gt;  ## dotted form of postfix operator (non-wordy only)
    | &lt;OPER=postcircumfix&gt;
    # Ditto here for recognized postcircumfixes
    | '.' &lt;?[ [ { &lt; ]&gt; &lt;OPER=postcircumfix&gt;
    | &lt;OPER=dotty&gt;
    | &lt;OPER=privop&gt;
    ]
}
</code></pre>

<p>Thus the <code>.</code> means nothing at all in this context. The parser simply accepts it and then moves on to look for the thing it actually cares about at that point.</p>

<p>One other thing worth noting is that postfix and postcircumfix operators all work after a dotty term too, operating on <code>$_</code>. Thus:</p>

<pre><code>my @xs = 1..10;
.++ for @xs;
say @xs;
</code></pre>

<p>Will produce:</p>

<pre><code>[2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11]
</code></pre>

<p>Here's a postcircumfix example:</p>

<pre><code>my %h = a =&gt; 1, b =&gt; 2, c =&gt; 3;
say .&lt;a&gt; + .&lt;c&gt; given %h;
</code></pre>

<p>Which produces <code>4</code>.</p>

<p>Perl 6 syntax is generally designed to make it easy to shift code from one form to another, and accepting the <code>.</code> in places even where it's not strictly needed eases that a little (so one could refactor to <code>say %h1.&lt;a&gt; + %h2.&lt;b&gt;;</code> and the parser will be fine with it). It may also be helpful for learning purposes to consider <code>%h&lt;a&gt;</code> short for <code>%h.&lt;a&gt;</code>, which would in turn make <code>.&lt;a&gt; given %h</code> a little less of a surprise.</p>

<p>The extra space afforded by the <code>.</code> may also aid clarity, especially if one was to stack multiple postfixes, and could even - should a language extension for some reason decide to define some ""interesting"" terms or postfix operators - serve as a means to disambiguate.</p>

<p>The calling code:</p>

<pre><code>    List&lt;Employee&gt; employeeList = DatabaseUtil.getEmployees();
    Collections.sort(employeeList, new BadgeComparator());
</code></pre>
","<h2>Explanation</h2>

<blockquote>
  <p>java.lang.IllegalArgumentException: Comparison method <strong>violates</strong> its general <strong>contract</strong>!</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The exception is not thrown from within your <code>try</code>. That is why it is not caught. The exception comes from <code>NotifierHTML.java:363</code> in your code where you call <code>Collection#sort</code> which uses a <code>TimSort</code> class. The exception is then thrown from <code>TimSort.java:868</code> by the <code>TimSort#mergeHi</code> method.</p>

<p>It tells you that your implementation of the <code>Comparator#compare</code> method is wrong. It violates the contract, as explained in its <a href=""https://docs.oracle.com/javase/10/docs/api/java/util/Comparator.html#compare(T,T)"" rel=""noreferrer"">documentation</a>:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Compares its two arguments for order. Returns a <strong>negative</strong> integer, <strong>zero</strong>, or a <strong>positive</strong> integer as the first argument is <strong>less than</strong>, <strong>equal to</strong>, or <strong>greater than</strong> the second.</p>
  
  <p>The implementor <strong>must ensure</strong> <code>sgn(x.compareTo(y)) == -sgn(y.compareTo(x))</code> for all <code>x</code> and <code>y</code>. (This implies that <code>x.compareTo(y)</code> must throw an exception iff <code>y.compareTo(x)</code> throws an exception.)</p>
  
  <p>The implementor <strong>must also ensure</strong> that the relation is <strong>transitive</strong>: <code>(x.compareTo(y) &gt; 0 &amp;&amp; y.compareTo(z) &gt; 0)</code> implies <code>x.compareTo(z) &gt; 0</code>.</p>
  
  <p>Finally, the implementor <strong>must ensure</strong> that <code>x.compareTo(y) == 0</code> implies that <code>sgn(x.compareTo(z)) == sgn(y.compareTo(z))</code>, for all <code>z</code>.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Your implementation violates one of those requirements and the method detected that.</p>

<hr>

<h2>Source of the problem</h2>

<p>The problem is that you return <code>-1</code> if an error occurs. Suppose you have two values <code>first</code> and <code>second</code>. And that at least one of them will provoke the exception.</p>

<p>So if you want to compare <code>first</code> with <code>second</code>, you get <code>-1</code>:</p>

<pre><code>compare(first, second) -&gt; -1
</code></pre>

<p>Which means that <code>first</code> is <strong>smaller</strong> than <code>second</code>. But if you compare it the other way you get <code>-1</code> too:</p>

<pre><code>compare(second, first) -&gt; -1
</code></pre>

<p>Because the exception is thrown in both variants, which leads to your <code>return -1;</code>. But this means your <code>compare</code> method says:</p>

<pre><code>first &lt; second
second &lt; first
</code></pre>

<p>Both at the same time, which is logically incorrect and violates the contract.</p>

<hr>

<h2>Solution</h2>

<p>You need to correctly define where in your ordering unparsable content is placed at. For example let us define that it is always smaller than any number. So we want</p>

<pre><code>text &lt; number
</code></pre>

<p>What do we do if both are unparsable? We could say they are equal, we could compare them lexicographical. Let's keep it simple and say that any two texts are considered equal:</p>

<pre><code>text = text
</code></pre>

<p>We implement this by checking which of the arguments are unparseable and then returning the correct value:</p>

<pre><code>@Override
public int compare(Employee first, Employee second) {
    Integer firstValue;
    Integer secondValue;
    try {
        firstValue = Integer.parseInt(first.getBadgeNumber());
    } catch (NumberFormatException e) {
        // Could not parse, set null as indicator
        firstValue = null;
    }
    try {
        secondValue = Integer.parseInt(second.getBadgeNumber());
    } catch (NumberFormatException e) {
        // Could not parse, set null as indicator
        secondValue = null;
    }

    if (firstValue == null &amp;&amp; secondValue != null) {
        // text &lt; number
        return -1;
    }
    if (firstValue != null &amp;&amp; secondValue == null) {
        // number &gt; text
        return 1;
    }
    if (firstValue == null &amp;&amp; secondValue == null) {
        // text = text
        return 0;
    }

    // Both are numbers
    return Integer.compare(firstValue, secondValue);
}
</code></pre>

<p>As hinted in the comments you could replace your whole custom <code>Comparator</code> class by the following statement which generates the same Comparator:</p>

<pre><code>Comparator&lt;Employee&gt; comp = Comparator.nullsLast(
    Comparator.comparing(e -&gt; tryParseInteger(e.getBadgeNumber())));
</code></pre>

<p>Together with a <code>tryParseInteger</code> method like this:</p>

<pre><code>public static Integer tryParseInteger(String text) {
    try {
        return Integer.parseInt(text);
    } catch (NumberFormatException e) {
        return null;
    }
}
</code></pre>

","<p>In my humble opinion, a lot of it comes down to existing skillsets.  If you have a team experienced in Spark, Java, Python, r or Scala then Databricks is a natural fit.  If on the other hand you have a team with existing SQL and c# skills, then the learning curve for them with U-SQL will be less steep.</p>

<p>That aside, there are other questions which can drive out differences:</p>

<ul>
<li>Do you require realtime interaction (Databricks) or batch mode analytics (both)?  Although there is a feedback item for real-time interactivity for U-SQL, <a href=""https://feedback.azure.com/forums/327234-data-lake/suggestions/11266677-support-interactive-workloads-within-adl-analytics"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">please vote</a>.</li>
<li>Do you want a pay-as-you-go model (U-SQL) or clusters with auto-terminate after a certain period (Databricks)?</li>
<li>Do you like working in a notebook (Databricks) or Visual Studio / VSCode / Powershell / .net sdk (U-SQL) method?</li>
<li>Do you want to use Spark libraries like GraphX (Databricks)?</li>
<li>Do you want the ability to run and scale any runtime (U-SQL)?  See <a href=""https://channel9.msdn.com/Events/Build/2017/P4004"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">here</a> for more details.</li>
<li>Do you want a local development emulator (U-SQL)?
The U-SQL emulator in Visual Studio is seamless, ie you develop your code against your local drives in the same structure as your lake (for <strong>free</strong>), then simply click the drop-down in Visual Studio to run in the cloud.  Although I think you can have a local Spark environment, I'm not sure what the local (and disconnected) development experience is for Databricks.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>UPDATE October 2018</strong>:
As far as I am aware, U-SQL does not currently support ADLS Gen 2, which would count against it (happy to be corrected).  I will update the post <strong>if</strong> and when that support is added.</p>

","<p>You could use reflection as proposed by <a href=""https://stackoverflow.com/a/50128845/7571171"">Joel Harkes</a>, e.g. I put together this reusable, ready-to-use extension method</p>

<pre><code>public static bool ArePropertiesNotNull&lt;T&gt;(this T obj)
{
    return typeof(T).GetProperties().All(propertyInfo =&gt; propertyInfo.GetValue(obj) != null);    
}
</code></pre>

<p>which can then be called like this</p>

<pre><code>var employee = new Employee();
bool areAllPropertiesNotNull = employee.ArePropertiesNotNull();
</code></pre>

<p>And now you can check the <code>areAllPropertiesNotNull</code> flag which indicates whether all properties are not null. Returns <code>true</code> if all properties are not null, otherwise <code>false</code>.</p>

<hr>

<h1>Advantages of this approach</h1>

<ul>
<li>It doesn't matter whether or not the property type is nullable or not for the check.</li>
<li>Since above method is generic, you can use it for any type you want and don't have to write boilerplate code for every type you want to check.</li>
<li>It is more future-proof in case you change the class later. (noted by <a href=""https://stackoverflow.com/users/939213/ispiro"">ispiro</a>). </li>
</ul>

<h1>Disadvantages</h1>

<ul>
<li>Reflection can be quite slow, and in this case it is certainly slower than writing explicit code as you currently do. Using simple caching (as proposed by <a href=""https://stackoverflow.com/users/5753629/reginald-blue"">Reginald Blue</a> will remove much of that overhead.</li>
</ul>

<p><sub>In my opinion, the slight performance overhead can be neglected since development time and repetition of code are reduced when using the <code>ArePropertiesNotNull</code>, but YMMV.</sub></p>

","<p>No. There is no such option in Chrome for iOS. I'm using iOS 11.3 on iPhone X with latest Chrome and I don't see such option. Safari for iOS had ""Add to home screen"" for a long time now. Its just the ""Service worker"" support that came recently in 11.3 version . </p>

<p>Notably, Chrome for iOS is just an <a href=""https://www.howtogeek.com/184283/why-third-party-browsers-will-always-be-inferior-to-safari-on-iphone-and-ipad/"" rel=""noreferrer"">wrapping layer</a> on top of Safari's WebKit and what it can perform at OS level is all heavily restricted in that sense. Depending on when and how Apple opens its API for 3rd party WebKit based browser implementer for iOS, we can hope to see this feature sometime in future.  </p>

I was told that this is true for larger types because the CPU can not atomically change the data without using some sort of lock.  </p>

<p>for example:</p>

<pre><code>#include &lt;iostream&gt;
#include &lt;atomic&gt;

struct foo {
    double a;
    double b;
};

std::atomic&lt;foo&gt; var;

int main()
{
    std::cout &lt;&lt; var.is_lock_free() &lt;&lt; std::endl;
    std::cout &lt;&lt; sizeof(foo) &lt;&lt; std::endl;
    std::cout &lt;&lt; sizeof(var) &lt;&lt; std::endl;
}
</code></pre>

<p>the output (Linux/gcc) is:</p>

<pre><code>0
16
16
</code></pre>

<p>Since the atomic and <code>foo</code> are the same size, I don't think a lock is stored in the atomic.</p>

<p>My question is:<br>
If an atomic variable uses a lock, where is it stored and what does that mean for multiple instances of that variable ?</p>
","<p>The easiest way to answer such questions is generally to just look at the resulting assembly and take it from there.</p>

<p>Compiling the following (I made your struct larger to dodge crafty compiler shenanigans):</p>

<pre><code>#include &lt;atomic&gt;

struct foo {
    double a;
    double b;
    double c;
    double d;
    double e;
};

std::atomic&lt;foo&gt; var;

void bar()
{
    var.store(foo{1.0,2.0,1.0,2.0,1.0});
}
</code></pre>

<p>In clang 5.0.0 yields the following under -O3: <a href=""https://godbolt.org/g/quZHyx"" rel=""noreferrer"">see on godbolt</a></p>

<pre><code>bar(): # @bar()
  sub rsp, 40
  movaps xmm0, xmmword ptr [rip + .LCPI0_0] # xmm0 = [1.000000e+00,2.000000e+00]
  movaps xmmword ptr [rsp], xmm0
  movaps xmmword ptr [rsp + 16], xmm0
  movabs rax, 4607182418800017408
  mov qword ptr [rsp + 32], rax
  mov rdx, rsp
  mov edi, 40
  mov esi, var
  mov ecx, 5
  call __atomic_store
</code></pre>

<p>Great, the compiler delegates to an intrinsic (<code>__atomic_store</code>), that's not telling us what's really going on here. However, since the compiler is open source, we can easily find the implementation of the intrinsic (I found it in <a href=""https://github.com/llvm-mirror/compiler-rt/blob/master/lib/builtins/atomic.c"" rel=""noreferrer"">https://github.com/llvm-mirror/compiler-rt/blob/master/lib/builtins/atomic.c</a>):</p>

<pre><code>void __atomic_store_c(int size, void *dest, void *src, int model) {
#define LOCK_FREE_ACTION(type) \
    __c11_atomic_store((_Atomic(type)*)dest, *(type*)dest, model);\
    return;
  LOCK_FREE_CASES();
#undef LOCK_FREE_ACTION
  Lock *l = lock_for_pointer(dest);
  lock(l);
  memcpy(dest, src, size);
  unlock(l);
}
</code></pre>

<p>It seems like the magic happens in <code>lock_for_pointer()</code>, so let's have a look at it:</p>

<pre><code>static __inline Lock *lock_for_pointer(void *ptr) {
  intptr_t hash = (intptr_t)ptr;
  // Disregard the lowest 4 bits.  We want all values that may be part of the
  // same memory operation to hash to the same value and therefore use the same
  // lock.  
  hash &gt;&gt;= 4;
  // Use the next bits as the basis for the hash
  intptr_t low = hash &amp; SPINLOCK_MASK;
  // Now use the high(er) set of bits to perturb the hash, so that we don't
  // get collisions from atomic fields in a single object
  hash &gt;&gt;= 16;
  hash ^= low;
  // Return a pointer to the word to use
  return locks + (hash &amp; SPINLOCK_MASK);
}
</code></pre>

<p>And here's our explanation: The address of the atomic is used to generate a hash-key to select a pre-alocated lock.</p>

In my example I have a class <code>Sample&lt;T&gt;</code> and an implicit conversion operator from <code>T</code> to <code>Sample&lt;T&gt;</code>. </p>

<pre><code>private class Sample&lt;T&gt;
{
   public readonly T Value;

   public Sample(T value)
   {
      Value = value;
   }

   public static implicit operator Sample&lt;T&gt;(T value) =&gt; new Sample&lt;T&gt;(value);
}
</code></pre>

<p>The problem occurs when using a nullable value type for <code>T</code> such as <code>int?</code>. </p>

<pre><code>{
   int? a = 3;
   Sample&lt;int&gt; sampleA = a;
}
</code></pre>

<p><strong>Here is the key part:</strong><br>
In my opinion this should not compile because <code>Sample&lt;int&gt;</code> defines a conversion from <code>int</code> to <code>Sample&lt;int&gt;</code> but not from <code>int?</code> to <code>Sample&lt;int&gt;</code>. <strong>But it compiles and runs successfully!</strong> (By which I mean the conversion operator is invoked and <code>3</code> will be assigned to the <code>readonly</code> field.)</p>

<p>And it gets even worse. Here the conversion operator isn't invoked and <code>sampleB</code> will be set to <code>null</code>:</p>

<pre><code>{
   int? b = null;
   Sample&lt;int&gt; sampleB = b;
}
</code></pre>

<p>A great answer would probably be split into two parts:</p>

<ol>
<li>Why does the code in the first snippet compile?</li>
<li>Can I prevent the code from compiling in this scenario?</li>
</ol>
","<p>You can take a look at how compiler lowers this code:</p>

<pre><code>int? a = 3;
Sample&lt;int&gt; sampleA = a;
</code></pre>

<p>into <a href=""https://sharplab.io/#v2:CYLg1APgAgDABFAjAbgLACgNQMwIExwDKAhgLYAOANgKYA8AKgHwYDeGcHOcATtccAHsAdpQCecenABqxSgFdqaTOg4JcJCjQAUkgG6yFASnYc2K1RxnzqcALxx91paoC+GE2oSIAbHACWmn4Axn4ALnAC5NTcxKEC3ERkVHRMOg4G1IZ2jHBC1ADuiZopjFqORkpuylxQBADCcGYWNQAscACyWllNFqoevX5CoQD8cMR2cNjOvRwaybSDoTkAzkk0AIITxNMcVS5AA="" rel=""noreferrer"">this</a>:</p>

<pre><code>int? nullable = 3;
int? nullable2 = nullable;
Sample&lt;int&gt; sample = nullable2.HasValue ? ((Sample&lt;int&gt;)nullable2.GetValueOrDefault()) : null;
</code></pre>

<p>Because <code>Sample&lt;int&gt;</code> is a class its instance can be assigned a null value and with such an implicit operator the underlying type of a nullable object can also be assigned. So assignments like these are valid:</p>

<pre><code>int? a = 3;
int? b = null;
Sample&lt;int&gt; sampleA = a; 
Sample&lt;int&gt; sampleB = b;
</code></pre>

<p>If <code>Sample&lt;int&gt;</code> would be a <code>struct</code>, that of course would give an error.</p>

<p><strong>EDIT:</strong>
So why is this possible? I couldn't find it in spec because it's a deliberate spec violation and this is only kept for backwards compatibility. You can read about it in <a href=""https://github.com/dotnet/roslyn/blob/1159a17a7a25737e56c5aac38ed26efd93c41bec/src/Compilers/CSharp/Portable/Lowering/LocalRewriter/LocalRewriter_Conversion.cs#L1058"" rel=""noreferrer"">code</a>:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>DELIBERATE SPEC VIOLATION:<br>
  The native compiler allows for a ""lifted"" conversion even when the return type of the conversion not a non-nullable value type. For example, if we have a conversion from struct S to string, then a ""lifted"" conversion from S? to string is considered by the native compiler to exist, with the semantics of ""s.HasValue ? (string)s.Value : (string)null"".  The Roslyn compiler perpetuates this error for the sake of backwards compatibility.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>That's how this ""error"" is <a href=""https://github.com/dotnet/roslyn/blob/1159a17a7a25737e56c5aac38ed26efd93c41bec/src/Compilers/CSharp/Portable/Lowering/LocalRewriter/LocalRewriter_Conversion.cs#L1080"" rel=""noreferrer"">implemented</a> in Roslyn:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Otherwise, if the return type of the conversion is a nullable value type, reference type or pointer type P, then we lower this as:</p>

<pre><code>temp = operand
temp.HasValue ? op_Whatever(temp.GetValueOrDefault()) : default(P)
</code></pre>
</blockquote>

<p>So according to <a href=""https://github.com/dotnet/csharplang/blob/master/spec/conversions.md#lifted-conversion-operators"" rel=""noreferrer"">spec</a> for a given user-defined conversion operator  <code>T -&gt; U</code> there exists a lifted operator <code>T? -&gt; U?</code> where <code>T</code> and <code>U</code> are non-nullable value types. However such logic is also implemented for a conversion operator where <code>U</code> is a reference type because of the above reason.</p>

<p><strong>PART 2</strong> How to prevent the code from compiling in this scenario? Well there is a way. You can define an additional implicit operator specifically for a nullable type and decorate it with an attribute <code>Obsolete</code>. That would require the type parameter <code>T</code> to be restricted to <code>struct</code>:</p>

<pre><code>public class Sample&lt;T&gt; where T : struct
{
    ...

    [Obsolete(""Some error message"", error: true)]
    public static implicit operator Sample&lt;T&gt;(T? value) =&gt; throw new NotImplementedException();
}
</code></pre>

<p>This operator will be chosen as a first conversion operator for nullable type because it's more specific. </p>

<p>If you can't make such a restriction you must define each operator for each value type separately (if you are <em>really</em> determined you can take advantage of reflection and generating code using templates): </p>

<pre><code>[Obsolete(""Some error message"", error: true)]
public static implicit operator Sample&lt;T&gt;(int? value) =&gt; throw new NotImplementedException();
</code></pre>

<p>That would give an error if referenced in any place in code:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Error CS0619  'Sample.implicit operator Sample(int?)' is obsolete: 'Some error message'</p>

<p>Thanks in advance!</p>
","<p>Anko is a project JetBrains started while developing Kotlin and making it relevant for Android. I'd qualify it as an early production-ready showcase of Kotlin possibilities.</p>

<p>Anko is well known for Anko layouts, but also has some extensions for Android development in Anko Commons, and also a few other modules like SQLite.</p>

<p>However, Anko libraries have accumulated a significant number of methods updates after updates, which today make the library relatively heavyweight when you are limited to 65K methods per dex file (I prefer staying with a single one, for apk size and performance reasons).</p>

<p>Anko commons provides extensions for Android, so it's similar to Android KTX in a way, but it's not as well integrated and organized (packages and artifacts wise) as Android KTX which is now part of AndroidX, which is part of Android Jetpack. Making the libraries smaller, and more loosely coupled is part of the Android Jetpack / Android X philosophy BTW.</p>

<p>So <strong>Android KTX, is clearly the future</strong>, and I see no reason to not jump in the ship, or rather, not letting it jump in your Android projects.</p>

<p>Also, <a href=""https://github.com/Kotlin/anko/issues/614"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">as you  yourself pointed out</a>, future Anko versions will deprecate (and probably finally remove) overlap with Android KTX, to provide only features that are not in AndroidX.</p>

<p><em>Includes a shameless plug:</em>
Since you're talking about Anko, if Anko layouts got your attention, but you experienced struggles with them (especially when interacting with custom or third-party views), I'd recommend you to check out View DSL in <a href=""https://github.com/LouisCAD/Splitties"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Splitties</a>, which is more flexible than Anko layouts, and very lightweight. The other modules may also interest you. I started this project to leverage Kotlin features in my Android projects at work and at home.</p>

<p>You've not asked about it, but here's my take on Anko coroutines:
I find the <code>bg { … }</code> extension confusing. I prefer to use kotlinx.coroutines with the Android artifact, using <code>launch</code>, <code>withContext</code>, etc, along with <code>Dispatchers.IO</code>.</p>

<p>However, the Anko coroutines listeners (e.g. <code>onClick</code> that can suspend) are not a bad idea IMO.</p>

<p><a href=""https://doc.qt.io/qt-5/qthread.html"" rel=""noreferrer"">This link</a> shows that both methods work. On what basis should I decide what to use from those two?</p>
","<p>I would focus on the differences between the two methods. There isn't a general answer that fits all use cases, so it's good to understand exactly what they are to choose the best that fits your case.</p>

<h1>Using moveToThread()</h1>

<p><em>moveToThread()</em> is used to control the <strong>object's thread affinity</strong>, which basically means setting the thread (or better the Qt event loop) from which the object will emit signals and its slots will be executed.</p>

<p>As shown in the documentation you linked, this can be used to run code on a different thread, basically creating a <strong>dummy worker</strong>, writing the code to run in a <strong>public slot</strong> (in the example the <em>doWork()</em> slot) and then using <strong>moveToThread</strong> to move it to a different event loop. </p>

<p>Then, a signal connected to that slot is fired. Since the object that emits the signal (the <em>Controller</em> in the example) lives in a different thread, and the signal is connected to our doWork method with a queued connection, the doWork method will be executed in the worker thread.</p>

<p>The key here is that you are creating a <strong>new event loop</strong>, run by the worker thread. Hence, once the doWork slot has started, the whole event loop will be busy until it exits, and this means that incoming signals will be queued.</p>

<h1>Subclassing QThread()</h1>

<p>The other method described in Qt's documentation is subclassing QThread. In this case, one overrides the default implementation of the QThread::run() method, which creates an event loop, to run something else.</p>

<p>There's nothing wrong with this approach itself, although there are several catches. </p>

<p>First of all, it is very easy to write unsafe code, because the <em>run()</em> method is the only one in that class that will be actually run on another thread. </p>

<p>If as an example, you have a member variable that you initialize in the constructor and then use in the <em>run()</em> method, your member is initialized in the thread of the caller and then used in the new thread.</p>

<p>Same story for any public method that could be called either from the caller or inside run().</p>

<p>Also slots would be executed from the caller's thread, (unless you do something really weird as <em>moveToThread(this)</em>) leading to extra confusion.</p>

<p>So, it is possible, but you really are on your own with this approach and you must pay extra attention.</p>

<h1>Other approaches</h1>

<p>There are of course alternatives to both approaches, depending on what you need. If you just need to run some code in background while your GUI thread is running you may consider using <a href=""http://doc.qt.io/qt-5/qtconcurrent.html#run"" rel=""noreferrer"">QtConcurrent::run()</a>.</p>

<p>However, keep in mind that QtConcurrent will use the global <em>QThreadPool</em>. If the whole pool is busy (meaning there aren't available threads in the pool), your code will not run immediately.</p>

<p>Another alternative, if you are at the least on C++11, is to use a lower level API such as <a href=""http://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/thread/thread"" rel=""noreferrer"">std::thread</a>.</p>

<p>""a <strong>static</strong> method that depends only on its parameters and no other data""</p>

<p>Would it not be possible to have an instance method be a pure method without it being static (as long as it doesn't modify parameters and doesn't have 'side-effects' like printing)?</p>

<p>I know for a pure method to be the pure, the return value only depends on the parameters and not on any other state, so perhaps the way instance methods are called means that the variables taken from the object calling the method don't count as parameters but as another ""state""?</p>

<p>Other than that I can't think of any reason why a non-static method couldn't be a pure method. </p>

<p>Here's an example:</p>

<pre><code>public class Rational {

    private int numer;
    private int denom;

    public Rational() {
        this.numer = 0;
        this.denom = 1;
    }

    public Rational(int numer, int denom) {
        this.numer = numer;
        this.denom = denom;
    }
}
</code></pre>

<p>The above defines a <code>Rational</code> class</p>

<p>You could then write a method in the <code>Rational</code> class which returns a <code>Rational</code> object as a <code>double</code> by either 'Method one' or 'Method two' below.</p>

<p>Method one:</p>

<pre><code>public double toDouble() {
    double x = this.numer;
    double y = this.denom;
    double fprat = x / y;
    return fprat;
}   
</code></pre>

<p>Method two:</p>

<pre><code>public static double toDouble(Rational rational)
{
    double x = rational.numer;
    double y = rational.denom;
    double fprat = x / y;
    return fprat;
} 
</code></pre>

<p>They essentially do exactly the same thing but one is a static method and the other is an instance method so their calls would be in a different format. Method two is certainly a pure method but would Method one, which is non-static, also be defined as a pure method under these circumstances?</p>
","<p>Conceptually, the only difference between a static method and an instance method is that instance method has a hidden parameter accessible through <code>this</code> keyword.</p>

<p>Therefore an instance method that does not mutate <code>this</code> is pure if it would otherwise qualify as a pure static method.</p>

<p>The issue here may be rather related to virtual dispatch which is prevented by <code>static</code>. A base class method may be pure whilst a derived class method may be impure while their contract in the Java type system is equal.</p>

","<p>The ""static"" part of that definition is superfluous. A method being <em>static</em> doesn't guarantee that it does not rely on any other state. I suspect the definition just wanted to make sure the method does not use instance variables.</p>

<p>On the other hand, technically you may also think of an instance method as a static method with a zero-th parameter, the object itself. If that object is <em>immmutable</em> (or the method does not change anything in the object), you could argue that the method is still pure. Basically you regard the ""object"" as an additional parameter.</p>

<pre><code>Unknown option: '--locale'

<p>The same is happening with <code>delete-output-path</code> and <code>named-chunks</code>. How can we set this flags now?</p>
","<p>As part of introducing <a href=""https://github.com/angular/angular-cli/wiki/angular-workspace"" rel=""noreferrer"">CLI Workspaces</a>, the developers have removed build-related command line switches in favor of configuring them inside the new <code>angular.json</code> file.<br>
After some digging into the new schema (available at the link above), the easiest way to reintroduce your localization switches would be to add them under the following path inside <code>angular.json</code>:  <em>projects/your-project/architect/build/options</em>.  </p>

<p>Then serve your app without any switches: <code>ng serve</code>.</p>

<p>In the long term, I suppose you are encouraged to define yourself different configurations and set those options over there. Again, see the schema for more about this.</p>

<p>Here is an example of what I did:  </p>

<p>Unfortunately, out of nowhere, some of my users are suffering this issue, as well as my own phone. On the other hand, for other users it seems to work perfectly fine.</p>

<ul>
<li><p>This issue appears only on maps in my app.</p></li>
<li><p>I've tried to clean Google Services's cache on my own phone - still nothing.</p></li>
<li><p>On my emulator it works fine.</p></li>
<li><p>I've searched all over the Internet and haven't managed to find a working solution for this.</p></li>
<li><p>The most important part is this: Most of the solutions that I've found were ones that needed to be done on a specific device, like cleaning a cache and then restarting the phone. But, when we are talking about an issue that occurs and harm a large portion of my users - there has to be a solution on which I can use in order to help them all at once, by myself, without them needing to do some actions on their own phones.</p></li>
</ul>

<p>Otherwise, it would be very frustrating for them, and it would make some of them uninstall my app, and because of what? A bug that I have nothing to do with? Everything worked just perfectly fine until about two days ago, and I didn't make any changes to my app since then at all... so... why?</p>
","<p>AFAICT there is nothing an app developer can do to fix it. As @xomena mentions in her answer Google is working on it.</p>

<p>Just to add the complete solution for an end-user here:</p>

<ul>
<li>go to <code>Settings</code> > <code>Apps &amp; Notifications</code> > <code>App</code> > <code>Google Play Services</code> > <code>Storage</code></li>
<li>click <code>Clear Cache</code></li>
<li>go to <code>Manage Space</code> and click <code>Clear all data</code></li>
</ul>

","<p>AngularFire maintainer here, we've had a number of breaking changes as we march towards 5.0 GA. In order to support Angular 6, recent releases of AngularFire require rxjs 6. While yes downgrading or pinning to an old version would work for quick and dirty fix, I wouldn't suggest that as it will leave you out of improvements to the libraries in the future.</p>

<p>I'd recommend upgrading rxj6 to version 6 and including <code>rxjs-compat</code> if you have dependencies that haven't yet upgraded:</p>

<p><code>npm i rxjs@^6.0 rxjs-compat</code></p>

<p>Keep an eye on the <a href=""https://github.com/angular/angularfire2/releases"" rel=""noreferrer"">angularfire changelog</a> for important information on any breaking changes; once we hit GA we will abide by semver.</p>

<p>And for reference here's the <a href=""https://github.com/ReactiveX/rxjs/blob/master/MIGRATION.md"" rel=""noreferrer"">RXJS 5 => 6 migration guide</a>.</p>

<p><strong>Error</strong></p>

<p><code>Module '""ng5/node_modules/rxjs/BehaviorSubject""' has no exported member 'BehaviorSubject'.</code></p>

<p><strong>data.service.ts</strong></p>

","<p>if you want to import all <code>RxJS</code> just do :</p>

<pre><code>import { BehaviorSubject } from 'rxjs';

<p>If you only need <code>BehaviorSubject</code> : </p>

<pre><code>import { BehaviorSubject } from 'rxjs/internal/BehaviorSubject';
</code></pre>

<p><strong>EDIT : Explication</strong></p>

<p>On ES6 / TypeScript all <code>import</code> is related to <code>export</code> keyword. If you go on <code>node_modules/rxjs/index.d.ts</code> you will see all exported Class. </p>

<p>This means what ever see as exported on this file can be imported as : <code>import { SomeThing } from 'rxjs';</code></p>

<p>But, your generated bundle file will inclure all RxJS stuff including unnecessary part of this library.</p>

<p>To avoid that, i recommand you to import from : <code>from 'rxjs/internal/SomeThing'</code> (replace SomeThing by what you need) </p>

<p>For operators, you can find it on <code>from 'rxjs/internal/operators/SomeThing'</code></p>

Using the Android SDK image works, so the issue seems to be with the Hyper-V VM.</p>
","<p>I managed to get past this error by doing the follow: </p>

<ol>
<li>Build and Run the application </li>
<li>The build will stall with at ""Waiting for Runtime Checks"" </li>
<li>In the emulator click the "">>"" arrows in the tool-bar to the right </li>
<li>Make a note of the IP address for the <strong>Windows Phone Emulator Internal Switch</strong> </li>
<li>Back in VS. From the menu select <strong>Tools->Android->Android ADB Command Prompt</strong> </li>
<li>Type ""adb connect [IP_FROM_STEP_#4]"" </li>
<li>The build should continue. </li>
</ol>

<p>You should only need to do this each time the emulator is started. It didn't solve the issue of VS not connecting automatically, but I find it's easy enough to do in order to carry on.</p>

<p>As a side note, if the applications runs and immediately quits, then do the following: </p>

<ol>
<li>Stop the emulator </li>
<li>Open the Hyper-V Manager application </li>
<li>Right-click the emulator and select ""Settings"" </li>
<li>Expand the ""Processor"" node and select ""Compatibility"" </li>
<li>Tick ""Migrate to physical computer with different processor version"" </li>
</ol>

<p><strong>UPDATE #1</strong></p>

<p>After looking at the link provided by @masound I found that the registry key was missing. So, I did the following:</p>

<ul>
<li>Added the ""Android SDK Tools"" key to ""HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Wow6432Node"".</li>
<li>Added a string value with the name ""Path"" and value "" C:\Program Files (x86)\Android\android-sdk"".</li>

<pre><code>gcc -c a.c -o a.o
g++ -c b.cpp -o b.o
g++ b.o a.o -o all.out

<p>In summary: Is this JPEG recoverable? </p>

<p>The approach used to get this back was more luck than judgement.  I think I can explain, though be aware it involves a hex editor...</p>

<p>The <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JPEG#Syntax_and_structure"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Wikipedia page</a> for the syntax of a JPEG file explains that it is made up of a series of <em>segments</em> each started by a two byte marker - <code>0xFF</code> and another byte to indicate the type of segment.</p>

<p>The hope was that it was just the Huffman table segment of the file that was wrong - as suggested by the error message.  Without needing to understand what a Huffman table is, it was enough to see that the same section on Wikipedia explains it is a <code>0xFF</code> <code>0xC4</code> marker for a Huffman table segment.</p>

<p>Further down the page, it mentions:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>The JPEG standard provides general-purpose Huffman tables; encoders
  may also choose to generate Huffman tables...</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Opening up a few other JPEG files found what looks like a standard set of 4 consecutive Huffman table segments - each starting with that <code>0xFF</code> <code>0xC4</code> marker.  The sample <code>corrupt.jpg</code> however just had one Huffman table - from position <code>0x00c8</code> to <code>0x02bc</code> below.</p>

<p>(Both contain that <code>&amp;'()*56789:CDEFGHIJSTUVWXYZcdefghijstuvwxyz</code> sequence you mentioned in their Huffman tables.  In the corrupt file it appears twice in that single Huffman table, in the 'more conventional' JPEGs it appears in the second and fourth Huffman tables.)</p>

<p>From there, the fixed image is a copy and paste of the standard 4 Huffman tables, in place of that range of bytes in <code>corrupt.jpg</code> - now from <code>0x00c8</code> to <code>0x0278</code> in the fixed file.</p>

<p>Because the JPEG format is based around scanning for segments between those <code>0xff</code> markers, you can just swap out the Huffman segments - there are no other pointers in the file to worry about.  As you said, the rest of the file looked like a plausible JPEG.</p>

<hr>

<p>Summary of the steps taken:</p>

<ul>
<li>Hex search the <code>corrupt.jpg</code> for <code>FF C4</code> and note the offset</li>
<li>Hex search for the next <code>FF</code>.  If it's another <code>FF C4</code> (so a second Huffman table) keep going</li>
<li>Delete the content from the first <code>FF C4</code> (included) up to but not including the next <code>FF</code></li>
<li>Instead replace it with the 'standard 4 Huffman tables'.  These are the bytes in the last sample below, or can be copied from <code>0x00c8</code> to <code>0x0278</code> in the fixed file</li>
</ul>

I'm aware you can set a flag when you create a project, but my project is already created and work has been done.</p>

<p>The new configuration file that gets generated with the new Angular CLI is now called <code>angular.json</code> rather than <code>angular-cli.json</code>. The scheme for the file is also different, with new properties.</p>

<p>In the old <code>angular-cli.json</code> there is a section where you can set the <code>stylExt</code> like so,</p>

<pre><code>""defaults"": {
    ""styleExt"": ""scss""
}
</code></pre>

<p>but I'm not sure where exactly to put this, as after the <code>""test""</code> and <code>""lint""</code> properties, gives a lint error of: </p>

<p><code>Matches multiple schemas when only one must validate.</code> </p>

<p>and building produces: </p>

<p><code>Schema validation failed with the following errors:
  Data path ""['defaults']"" should NOT have additional properties(styleExt).</code></p>

<p>Looking at <a href=""https://github.com/angular/angular-cli/wiki/angular-workspace"" rel=""noreferrer"">CLI's docs</a> I'm not seeing anything that would indicate where to put <code>""styleExt""</code>.</p>

<p>I've seen other answers advising: <code>ng set defaults.styleExt scss</code> which throws<code>get/set have been deprecated in favor of the config command.</code>. </p>

<p>I tried <code>ng config set defaults.styleExt scss</code> and <code>npm config set defaults.styleExt scss</code> with the former throwing an error and the latter apparently having no effect on the file, but without error.</p>
","<p>In Angular 6, It's more easier then that. The compilation is handled automatically!
How that ?
To use <strong>scss</strong> at components level you need to name the file with the extension <strong>scss</strong> (same go for <strong>less, styl</strong>). And in your <strong>component.ts</strong> you change the corresponding style to <strong>scss</strong> too.</p>

<p>Here a screenshoot from the doc:
<a href=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/mIpGP.png"" rel=""noreferrer""><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/mIpGP.png"" alt=""enter image description here""></a></p>

<p>And to use Scss at a globale scale (src/styles.css), then you need to change styles.css to styles.scss (same go for less, styl ...etc). And then you go on angular.json and change the old styles.css to the new styles.scss value. As shown in the image bellow:</p>

<p><a href=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/619xD.png"" rel=""noreferrer""><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/619xD.png"" alt=""enter image description here""></a></p>

<p>Here the link for the doc for the first part for the ones that want to explore themselves:
<a href=""https://angular.io/guide/component-styles#non-css-style-files"" rel=""noreferrer"">https://angular.io/guide/component-styles#non-css-style-files</a></p>

<p><strong>Now what about setting up, ng-cli so when generating new component the extension will be by default scss ?</strong>
Use the <code>ng config</code> command as follow:</p>

<pre><code> ng config schematics.@schematics/angular:component.styleext scss
</code></pre>

<p>That will update angular.json with:</p>

<pre><code>""schematics"": {
    ""@schematics/angular:component"": {
        ""styleext"": ""scss""
    }
} 
</code></pre>

<p>Which is the equivalent to the old angular-cli.json </p>

<pre><code>    defaults: {
        ""styleext"": ""scss""
    }
</code></pre>

<p>That's for a project that is already started but not set to default to scss. If you are creating a new project then use the option <code>--style</code> to specify that as follow:</p>

<pre><code>ng new my-project --style=scss
</code></pre>

<p>And you will not have to use the precedent command which is a config command that allow us to update the specified field in the angular.json file (because it will be already set).</p>

<p>However, when changing filters on the site (for instance, in my use case, restricting the table to the current season), and using the arrows to access the next 20 entries in the table, the URL does not change. </p>

<p>I have found the relevant areas of the source code. They are: </p>

<pre><code>&lt;div data-script=""pl_stats"" data-widget=""stats-table"" data-current-size=""20""

<blockquote>
  <p><strong>Angular v6 Onwards</strong></p>
</blockquote>

<p>CLI projects in angular 6 onwards will be using  <code>angular.json</code> instead of <code>.angular-cli.json</code> for build and project configuration.</p>

<p>Each CLI workspace has projects, each project has targets, and each target can have configurations.<strong><a href=""https://blog.angular.io/version-6-of-angular-now-available-cc56b0efa7a4"" rel=""noreferrer"">Docs</a></strong></p>

<p><strong>OPTION-1</strong><br>
execute <code>npm install bootstrap@4 jquery --save</code><br>
The JavaScript parts of <code>Bootstrap</code> are dependent on <code>jQuery</code>. So you need the <code>jQuery</code> <code>JavaScript</code> library file too.<br>
<br>
 In your angular.json  add the file paths  to the styles and scripts array in under <code>build</code> target<br>
 <strong>NOTE:</strong>
Before v6 the Angular CLI project configuration was stored in <code>&lt;PATH_TO_PROJECT&gt;/.angular-cli.json.</code> As of v6 the location of the file changed to <code>angular.json.</code> Since there is no longer a leading dot, the file is no longer hidden by default and is on the same level.
<br>which also means that file paths in angular.json should not contain leading dots and slash  </p>

<blockquote>
  <p>i.e you can provide an absolute path instead of a relative path</p>
</blockquote>

<p>In <code>.angular-cli.json</code> file Path was <code>""../node_modules/""</code><br>
 In <code>angular.json</code> it is <code>""node_modules/""</code>  </p>

<p>Also, I don't have any <code>cordova-android</code>  folders in <code>C:\Users\%USER%\.cordova\lib\npm_cache</code> (I don't know if this helps. I saw people talking about this folder)</p>

<p>What's the problem here? Where is that URL coming from? How can I change it and with what can I change it? </p>

<p>If I cannot solve this easily there is one last step to do: remove and install everything again.</p>

We have a shared library that we are getting build errors.  Being a Java shop, we got in the habit of marking our component methods and attributes private.  In Angular 6 when building our library (after converting and using the new library CLI capability), we get:</p>

<pre><code>Property 'getCurrentYear' is private and only accessible within class.
</code></pre>

<p>In effect any attribute or method used in a template html cannot be marked private anymore on the component class.  Of course we can fix this by removing the 'private' modifier.  This was not the case in angular 5 when we produced our library using <a href=""https://github.com/raphael-volt/ng2-testable-lib"" rel=""noreferrer"">https://github.com/raphael-volt/ng2-testable-lib</a>.</p>

<p>Oddly enough, this ONLY happens when compiling our library.  We upgraded an app to angular 6 that also has private attributes and methods on the component / usage in template and no issues there.</p>

<p>Did we find a bug?  Is there a best practice we are not adhering to?</p>
","<p>In Angular we have 2 models of compilation<br></p>

<ul>
<li><p><strong>JIT - Just-in-Time Compilation</strong> : JIT compilation as the name implies, compiles the application Just-in-Time in the browser at
runtime.<br></p></li>
<li><p><strong>AoT - Ahead-of-Time Compilation :</strong> AoT compilation compiles the application at build time.</p></li>
</ul>

<p>By default, with the development build i.e <code>ng serve</code> we get JIT compilation. This is how it works. The application code along with the angular compiler is downloaded by the browser. At runtime, when a request is issued to the application, the JIT-compiler in the browser compiles the application code before it is executed.</p>

<p>with the production build i.e <code>ng build --prod</code> we get  AoT compilation the angular application is pre-compiled. So this means the browser loads executable code so it can render the application immediately, without waiting to compile the application first.</p>

<p>TypeScript <code>public</code> doesn't matter but <code>private</code> does</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><strong>From Angular Docs</strong><br>
  All <strong><a href=""https://stackoverflow.com/a/39367574/5695162""><code>data bound</code></a></strong> properties must be TypeScript public
  properties. Angular never binds to a TypeScript private property.<br></p>
</blockquote>

<p><strong><em>Actually, it does bind to the <code>private</code> properties, but not in <code>AoT mode</code><br></em></strong></p>

<p><strong><a href=""https://github.com/angular/angular/issues/11978"" rel=""noreferrer""><code>Why AOT Compiler requires public properties, while non-AOT allows private properties?</code></a></strong><br></p>

<p>With JIT we convert all the code to ES5 and then at runtime, we do the bindings. All the visibility modifiers are lost in that process, so it doesn't matter if you say <code>public</code> or <code>private</code> for that.</p>

<p>On the other hand, with AoT, we generate some typescript code for our templates, that will try to access those fields. If they are <code>private</code>, they simply cannot access those properties, hence, you need to put them as <code>public</code>.</p>

<p>Suppose in a dockerized project path there is a <code>docker-compose.yml</code> file:</p>

<pre><code>docker-compose build
</code></pre>

<p>And</p>

<pre><code>docker build
</code></pre>
","<p><code>docker-compose</code> is a wrapper around the docker CLI in order to gain time and avoid 500 characters-long lines (and also start multiple containers at the same time). It uses a file called <code>docker-compose.yml</code> in order to retrieve parameters.</p>

<p>You can find the reference for the docker-compose file format <a href=""https://docs.docker.com/compose/compose-file/"" rel=""noreferrer"">here</a>.</p>

<p>So basically <code>docker-compose build</code> will read your <code>docker-compose.yml</code>, look for all services containing the <code>build:</code> statement and run a <code>docker build</code> for each one.</p>

<p><a href=""https://docs.docker.com/compose/compose-file/#build"" rel=""noreferrer"">Each <code>build:</code></a> can specify a <code>Dockerfile</code>, a context and args to pass to docker.</p>

<p>To conclude with an example <code>docker-compose.yml</code> file :</p>

<pre><code>version: '3.2'

services:
  database:
    image: mariadb
    restart: always
    volumes:
      - ./.data/sql:/var/lib/mysql

  web:
    build:
      dockerfile: Dockerfile-alpine
      context: ./web
    ports:
      - 8099:80
    depends_on:
      - database 
</code></pre>

<p>When calling <code>docker-compose build</code>, only the <code>web</code> target will need an image to be built. The <code>docker build</code> command would look like :</p>

<pre><code>docker build -t web_myproject -f Dockerfile-alpine ./web

","<p><code>pipe()</code> is a method which simply takes arguments and each argument is an operator you want/can apply to your observable.</p>

<p>Here is the way how you can use the new method <code>pipe()</code> in Version 6:</p>

<pre><code>loadProducts() {
    return this.http.get(""/api/products"")
        pipe(
           map((data: any[]) =&gt; {
             this.products = data;
             return true;
           }), catchError( error =&gt; {
             return throwError( 'Something went wrong!' )
           });
        )
}
</code></pre>

<p>Keep in mind that with Version 6 you should now use <code>catchError</code> and <code>throwError</code> instead of:<code>catch</code> and <code>throw</code>. Here is the correct import with Version 6:</p>

<p><code>import { Observable, of, throwError, ...} from ""rxjs""</code></p>

<p><code>import { map, catchError, ...} from ""rxjs/operatros""</code></p>

<p>What's happening here?</p>
","<p>In general it is rather pointless to discuss why undefined behaviour leads to this result or the other.</p>

<p>But maybe it doesn't harm to try to understand why something happens even if it is outside the spec.</p>

<p>There are implementation of <code>isalpha</code> which use a simple array to lookup all possible <code>unsigned char</code> values. In that case the value passed as parameter is used as index into the array.
While a real character is limited to 8 bits, an integer is not.
The function takes an <code>int</code> as parameter. This is to allow entering <code>EOF</code> as well which does not fit into <code>unsigned char</code>.</p>

<p>If you pass an address like 0x7239482342 into your function this is far beyond the end of the said array and when the CPU tries to read the entry with that index it falls off the rim of the world. ;)</p>

<p>Calling <code>isalpha</code> with such an address is the place where the compiler should raise some warning about converting a pointer to an integer. Which you probably ignore...</p>

<p>The library <strong>might</strong> contain code that checks for valid parameters but it might also just rely on the user not passing things that shall not be passed.</p>

<p>It can be invoked, for example, like this:</p>

<p>But what if I want to pass additional arguments to the function, based on the number of variadic template arguments? For example, let's say I want to pass a character string literal for every Args:</p>

<pre class=""lang-cpp prettyprint-override""><code>auto ret = foo&lt;int, bool&gt;(""a"", ""b"");
</code></pre>

<p>The problem with this, is that it does not seem possible to expand non-variadic arguments, so the following obviously doesn't compile:</p>

<pre class=""lang-cpp prettyprint-override""><code>template &lt;class... Args&gt;
std::tuple&lt;Args...&gt; foo(const char*... names);

<p>And then in the code where you're awaiting an async function to resolve, you would add a check before setting state:</p>

<pre><code>async componentDidUpdate(prevProps, prevState) {

<p>This, however, does not work for an <code>std::array</code> of <code>std::pair</code>. </p>

<p>Why do these work:</p>

<pre><code>std::pair&lt;int, int&gt; p { 1, 2 };
std::array&lt;int, 3&gt; a {1, 2, 3};
</code></pre>

<p>but does this <em>not</em> work:</p>

<p>while this does work again?</p>

<pre><code>std::array&lt;std::pair&lt;int, int&gt;, 3&gt; b {{{1, 11}, {2, 22}, {3, 33}}};

<p>Also, for completion, the initialization of a good old array does work with single braces</p>

<pre><code>std::pair&lt;int, int&gt; c[3] {{1, 11}, {2, 22}, {3, 33}};
</code></pre>
","<p>This appears to be a parsing ambuguity somewhat similar to the famous  <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Most_vexing_parse"" rel=""noreferrer"">most vexing parse</a>. I suspect what's going on is that:</p>

<p>If you write</p>

<pre><code>std::array&lt;std::pair&lt;int, int&gt;, 3&gt; b {{1, 11}, {2, 22}, {3, 33}};
</code></pre>

<p>the compiler has two ways to interpret the syntax:</p>

<ol>
<li><p>You perform a full-brace initialization (meaning the outermost brace refers to the aggregate initialization of the <code>std::array</code>, while the first innermost one initializes the internal member representation of <code>std::array</code> which is a real C-Array). This will fail to compile, as <code>std::pair&lt;int, int&gt;</code> subsequently cannot be initialized by <code>1</code> (all braces are used up). clang will give a compiler error indicating exactly that:</p>

<pre><code>error: no viable conversion from 'int' to 'std::pair&lt;int, int&gt;'
 std::array&lt;std::pair&lt;int, int&gt;, 3&gt; a{{1, 11}, {2, 22}, {3, 33}};
                                          ^
</code></pre>

<p>Note also this problem is resolved if there is no internal member aggregate to be initialized, i.e.</p>

<pre><code>std::pair&lt;int, int&gt; b[3] = {{1, 11}, {2, 22}, {3, 33}};
</code></pre>

<p>will compile just fine as aggregate initialization.</p></li>
<li><p>(The way you meant it.) You perform a brace-elided initialization, the innermost braces therefore are for aggregate-initialization of the individual pairs, while the braces for the internal array representations are elided. Note that even if there wasn't this ambiguity, as correctly pointed out in <a href=""https://stackoverflow.com/a/50599168/7703564"">rustyx's answer</a>, the rules of brace elision do not apply as <code>std::pair</code> is no aggregate type so the program would still be ill-formed.</p></li>
</ol>

<p>The compiler will prefer option 1. By providing the extra braces, you perform the full-brace initialization and lift any syntactical ambiguity.</p>

<p>I did some googling and Java release history etc. But couldn't find any concrete reason.</p>

<p>I have couple of questions-</p>

<ol>
<li>Oracle is still supporting the JDK 1.8, but stopped releasing updates to JDK 9, why?</li>
<li>Should I continue using JDK 1.8 for some time and then directly switch to JDK 10?</li>
</ol>
","<p>In the past, Java major releases often tended to be loaded with far-reaching features that had a massive impact on the code that you could and should write, like generics (Java 5) and functional constructs (Java 8).</p>

<p>With Java 9 they introduced a new modularization system (project Jigsaw), that also has a massive impact on the JVM architecture (although, not so much on the language syntax). They had to postpone the release of Java 9 two times because of disagreements on the implementation of that feature with other influential members of the Java community.</p>

<p>Presumably drawing a lesson from this, Oracle decided to overhaul the development style for Java to be more incremental or ""agile"", if you like. Instead of having feature loaded major releases that can sometimes take many years to finish, they want to publish major releases with less new features each in a fixed release schedule every six months.</p>

<p>Java 9 and Java 10 are the first two versions scheduled with this new release model and Java 9 already got deprecated with the release of Java 10. <strong>Java 11</strong>, which is supposed to be released in September 2018 will be a <strong>Long Term Support (LTS)</strong> release with <strong>support until 2026</strong> (<a href=""https://www.theregister.co.uk/2018/03/09/java_release_train_qcon/"" rel=""noreferrer"">Source</a>). This is very similar to what many are used to from the Ubuntu release model (On a side note, they even planned to replace the version numbers with something involving the year and month of release or so, similar to what Canonical is doing with Ubuntu, but dropped that idea for some reason).</p>

<p>Using a non-LTS version of Java now implies a commitment to update your software that uses the JDK every 6 month. It shouldn't be as involved as migrating code from one major Java version to another in the past because, as described, the language changes are supposed to happen in a more incremental way, but it's definitely something to consider. If you don't want to make this commitment, you should stick to the LTS versions, which means to stay with Java 8 at least until the release of Java 11.</p>

<p>Even after the release of Java 11, it might be necessary to stick with Java 8 if the toolchain to be used does not fully support Java 11 right away.</p>

I was wondering why we need to explicitly declare <code>auto</code> if the compiler is able to automatically deduce the type. I know C++ is a strongly typed language and this is a rule but was it not possible to achieve the same outcome without explicitly declaring a variable <code>auto</code>?</p>
","<h2>In short: <code>auto</code> could be dropped in some cases, but that would lead to inconsistency.</h2>

<p>First of all, as pointed, the declaration syntax in C++ is <code>&lt;type&gt; &lt;varname&gt;</code>. Explicit declarations require some type or at least a declaration keyword in its place. So we could use <code>var &lt;varname&gt;</code> or <code>declare &lt;varname&gt;</code> or something, but <code>auto</code> is a long standing keyword in C++, and is a good candidate for automatic type deduction keyword.</p>

<p><strong>Is it possible to implicitly declare variables by assignment without breaking everything?</strong></p>

<p>Sometimes yes. You can't perform assignment outside functions, so you could use assignment syntax for declarations there. But such approach would bring inconsistency to the language, possibly leading to human errors.</p>

<pre><code>a = 0; // Error. Could be parsed as auto declaration instead.
int main() {
  return 0;
}
</code></pre>

<p>And when it comes to any kind of local variables explicit declarations are they way of controlling the scope of a variable.</p>

<pre><code>a = 1; // use a variable declared before or outside
auto b = 2; // declare a variable here
</code></pre>

<p>If ambiguous syntax was allowed, declaring global variables could suddenly convert local implicit declarations to assignments. Finding those conversions would require checking <em>everything</em>. And to avoid collisions you would need unique names for all globals, which kind of destroys the whole idea of scoping. So it's really bad.</p>

<pre><code>Repeat repeat = Repeat.Daily.Weekly.Yearly.Weekly;

<p>which is equivalent to:</p>

<pre><code>Repeat repeat = Repeat.Weekly;
</code></pre>

<p>May I know why such syntax is allowed? Is there a way to let the compiler warn us against this?</p>
","<p>This is allowed as <code>Daily, Weekly, Yearly</code> are the <code>static</code> field by <code>default</code> inside the <code>enum</code> and holds the object of <code>Repeat</code>.  Also, you will get a warning from the compiler <code>""The static field Repeat.Weekly should be accessed in a static way""</code>. It is similar to below lines of code.</p>

","<p>I found that you need to do two steps to resolve this issue:</p>

<ol>
<li>Delete the <code>.vs</code> folder at the solution level.</li>
<li>Delete the <code>bin</code> and <code>obj</code> folders in all projects within the solution.</li>
</ol>

","<p>Most likely there were errors in one of those commands. For me, I had to run <code>npm install -g @angular-devkit/core</code> first and then run the commands:</p>

be updated automatically by running the following command:

<p>Why does <code>std::foreach</code> work with a <code>std::vector&lt;int&gt;</code>, but does not work with a <code>std::vector&lt;bool&gt;</code>?</p>

<p>Is the memory optimisation of an <code>std::vector&lt;bool&gt;</code> (see <a href=""https://stackoverflow.com/questions/46115669/why-does-stdvectorbool-have-no-data"">here</a> ) part of the answer?</p>
","<h2>Reason</h2>

<p>The problem stems from the fact that dereferencing an iterator that came from <a href=""https://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/container/vector_bool"" rel=""noreferrer""><code>std::vector&lt;bool&gt;</code></a>  doesn't return <code>bool&amp;</code>, but rather a proxy object. Thus, <a href=""https://stackoverflow.com/questions/17794569/why-is-vectorbool-not-a-stl-container"">it is not regarded as stl container</a> (thanks to @KillzoneKid).</p>

<h2>Fix</h2>

<p>Use <code>auto element</code> in the parameter list. In general, if you don't care about the type, use <code>auto&amp;&amp;</code> in the lambda parameter list.</p>

<pre><code>#include &lt;vector&gt;
#include &lt;iostream&gt;
#include &lt;algorithm&gt;

int main () {
    std::vector&lt;bool&gt; list {true, true, false};
    auto reset = [](auto &amp;&amp; element){element = false;};

    auto print = [](int element) {std::cout&lt;&lt; element &lt;&lt; "" "";};
    std::for_each(list.begin(), list.end(),reset);
    std::for_each(list.begin(), list.end(),print);

}
</code></pre>

<p><a href=""https://wandbox.org/permlink/hSV4OrF7L4l9fmly"" rel=""noreferrer"">Demo</a>.</p>

<p>Trying to use <code>auto&amp;</code> will <a href=""https://godbolt.org/g/e1Rrtz"" rel=""noreferrer"">trigger compilation error again</a>, as the proxy returned is not lvalue, but rvalue. Thus, <code>auto&amp;&amp;</code> has even more benefits than usual.</p>

<p>For me I choose the option of adding the ApplicationPartManager before adding MVC, eg.</p>

<pre><code>var manager = new ApplicationPartManager();
manager.ApplicationParts.Add(new AssemblyPart(typeof(Startup).Assembly));

services.AddSingleton(manager);
services.AddMvc();

Like if the I select the cube of 5x5 which is by default a cube but when the I select the option of 5x10 the width(front) should not be changed but the length(side) of the cube should expand, and vice versa if I select 10x5 my max option is 25x15. As you can see the canvas I created below is in pixels, first I need to convert these pixels into centimeters(cm) then centimeters to cubic meters.</p>

<p>The whole cube should be aligned in the fixed canvas area specified.</p>

","<p><strong>Drawing the cube</strong>:</p>

<p>To generate a dynamic cube you would have to listen to an onChange event on the <code>&lt;select&gt;</code> element. Every time the selected option changes you would want to redraw your cube.</p>

<p>To redraw the cube you need to create a <code>renderCube</code> function which should take the new dimensions of the cube and as specified an offset for positioning. In this function you have to clear the previously drawn cube and redraw the new one with the given dimensions and offset.</p>

<p><strong>Adding a transition effect</strong>:</p>

<p>As you can not apply css transitions to canvas elements you have to implement the transition yourself. You would have to create an animation function which would calculate the dimensions of the cube in the transition phase and rerender it to the screen on each frame.</p>

<p><strong>An implementation of the resizable cube with a transition effect would be</strong>:<br>

<p>The library you use has not updated yet and is therefore only compatible with an angular version before 1.6.7. But since you get this error, the angular version you use is probably higher.</p>

<p>You can either </p>

<p><strong>(A) Downgrade angular to 1.6.7, in your bower.json:</strong></p>

<pre><code>""dependencies"": {

","<p>I found the solution which some great guy posted on GitHub. Instead of downgrading your firebaseUI database, you can add arch common and runtime dependencies which are these:</p>

<pre><code>//Arch
    implementation ""android.arch.core:runtime:1.1.1""
    implementation ""android.arch.core:common:1.1.1""
</code></pre>

<p>Just add these in your app: module dependencies section and you know build it.</p>

","<p>The biggest difference between {dplyr} and {purrr} is that {dplyr} is designed to work on data.frames only, and {purrr} is designed to work on every kind of lists. Data.frames being lists, you can also use {purrr} for iterating on a data.frame. </p>

<pre><code>map_chr(iris, class)
Sepal.Length  Sepal.Width Petal.Length  Petal.Width      Species 
   ""numeric""    ""numeric""    ""numeric""    ""numeric""     ""factor"" 
</code></pre>

<p><code>summarise_at</code> and <code>map_at</code> do not exactly behave the same: <code>summarise_at</code> just return the summary you're looking for, <code>map_at</code> return all the data.frame as a list, with the modification done where you asked it : </p>

<pre><code>&gt; library(purrr)
&gt; library(dplyr)

&gt; map_at(small_iris, c(""Sepal.Length"", ""Sepal.Width""), mean)

1         0.77        0.28          6.7         2.0  virginica

</code></pre>

<p>So to sum up on your first question, if you are thinking about doing operation ""column-wise"" on a non-nested df and want to have a data.frame as a result, you should go for {dplyr}. </p>

<p>Regarding nested column, you have to combine <code>group_by()</code>, <code>nest()</code> from {tidyr}, <code>mutate()</code> and <code>map()</code>. What you're doing here is creating a smaller version of your dataframe that will contain a column which is a list of data.frames. Then, you're going to use <code>map()</code> to iterate over the elements inside this new column. </p>

<p>Here is an example with our beloved iris: </p>

<pre><code>library(tidyr)

iris_n &lt;- iris %&gt;% 
  group_by(Species) %&gt;% 
  nest()
iris_n
# A tibble: 3 x 2
  Species    data             
  &lt;fct&gt;      &lt;list&gt;           
1 setosa     &lt;tibble [50 × 4]&gt;
2 versicolor &lt;tibble [50 × 4]&gt;
3 virginica  &lt;tibble [50 × 4]&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>Here, the new object is a data.frame with the colum <code>data</code> being a list of smaller data.frames, one by Species (the factor we specified in <code>group_by()</code>). Then, we can iterate on this column by simply doing : </p>

<pre><code>map(iris_n$data, ~ lm(Sepal.Length ~ Sepal.Width, data = .x))
[[1]]

Call:
lm(formula = Sepal.Length ~ Sepal.Width, data = .x)

Coefficients:
(Intercept)  Sepal.Width  
     2.6390       0.6905  


[[2]]

Call:
lm(formula = Sepal.Length ~ Sepal.Width, data = .x)

Coefficients:
(Intercept)  Sepal.Width  
     3.5397       0.8651  


[[3]]

Call:
lm(formula = Sepal.Length ~ Sepal.Width, data = .x)

Coefficients:
(Intercept)  Sepal.Width  
     3.9068       0.9015  
</code></pre>

<p>But the idea is to keep everything inside a data.frame, so we can use <code>mutate</code> to create a column that will keep this new list of <code>lm</code> results: </p>

<pre><code>iris_n %&gt;%
  mutate(lm = map(data, ~ lm(Sepal.Length ~ Sepal.Width, data = .x)))
# A tibble: 3 x 3
  Species    data              lm      
  &lt;fct&gt;      &lt;list&gt;            &lt;list&gt;  
1 setosa     &lt;tibble [50 × 4]&gt; &lt;S3: lm&gt;
2 versicolor &lt;tibble [50 × 4]&gt; &lt;S3: lm&gt;
3 virginica  &lt;tibble [50 × 4]&gt; &lt;S3: lm&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>So you can run several <code>mutate()</code> to get the <code>r.squared</code> for e.g: </p>

<pre><code>iris_n %&gt;%
  mutate(lm = map(data, ~ lm(Sepal.Length ~ Sepal.Width, data = .x)), 
         lm = map(lm, summary), 
         r_squared = map_dbl(lm, ""r.squared"")) 
# A tibble: 3 x 4
  Species    data              lm               r_squared
  &lt;fct&gt;      &lt;list&gt;            &lt;list&gt;               &lt;dbl&gt;
1 setosa     &lt;tibble [50 × 4]&gt; &lt;S3: summary.lm&gt;     0.551
2 versicolor &lt;tibble [50 × 4]&gt; &lt;S3: summary.lm&gt;     0.277
3 virginica  &lt;tibble [50 × 4]&gt; &lt;S3: summary.lm&gt;     0.209
</code></pre>

<p>But a more efficient way is to use <code>compose()</code> from {purrr} to build a function that will do it once, instead of repeating the <code>mutate()</code>. </p>

<pre><code>get_rsquared &lt;- compose(as_mapper(""r.squared""), summary, lm)

iris_n %&gt;%
  mutate(lm = map_dbl(data, ~ get_rsquared(Sepal.Length ~ Sepal.Width, data = .x)))
# A tibble: 3 x 3
  Species    data                 lm
  &lt;fct&gt;      &lt;list&gt;            &lt;dbl&gt;
1 setosa     &lt;tibble [50 × 4]&gt; 0.551
2 versicolor &lt;tibble [50 × 4]&gt; 0.277
3 virginica  &lt;tibble [50 × 4]&gt; 0.209
</code></pre>

<p>If you know you'll always be using <code>Sepal.Length ~ Sepal.Width</code>, you can even prefill <code>lm()</code> with <code>partial()</code>:</p>

<pre><code>pr_lm &lt;- partial(lm, formula = Sepal.Length ~ Sepal.Width)
get_rsquared &lt;- compose(as_mapper(""r.squared""), summary, pr_lm)

iris_n %&gt;%
  mutate(lm = map_dbl(data, get_rsquared))
# A tibble: 3 x 3
  Species    data                 lm
  &lt;fct&gt;      &lt;list&gt;            &lt;dbl&gt;
1 setosa     &lt;tibble [50 × 4]&gt; 0.551
2 versicolor &lt;tibble [50 × 4]&gt; 0.277
3 virginica  &lt;tibble [50 × 4]&gt; 0.209
</code></pre>

<p>I'am quite confused how to fix that issue. Thanks in advance.</p>
","<p>It's an issue with firebase version 5.0.6 whereas downgrading to a version will resolve this issue.for example  try this</p>

<p><code>$ npm install --save firebase@5.0.4</code></p>

<p>To me, this makes no sense since <em>we do not</em> store the access token anywhere except for the current session and recreate it every time the user logs in with Facebook.</p>

</code></pre>

<p>The issue is probably related to <a href=""https://developers.facebook.com/blog/post/2018/04/09/user-access-token-changes"" rel=""noreferrer"">changes in the Facebook API</a>, but I do not see how this affects the short lived access tokens we create on every login.</p>
","<p>I ran into this issue when our integration tests logged in with a test user - the following JSON came back from the Graph API:</p>

<pre><code>{
    ""error"": {
        ""message"": ""The access token is invalid since the user hasn't engaged the app in longer than 90 days."",
        ""type"": ""OAuthException"",

    },
    ""timestamp_microsecond"": ""2018-05-30 11:22:01.353949""
}
</code></pre>

<p>That was a bigger problem as our test users don't ""engage"" with the app as such. To fix this I had to:</p>

<ul>
<li>Log into the FB developer site</li>
<li>Find the app in question</li>
<li>Look under Roles -> Test Users to find the right user</li>
<li>Click on the Edit button for the user and then click ""Login as this test user""</li>
<li>Once I'd logged in, go to Settings -> Apps &amp; Websites</li>
<li>Find the App in the ""Expired"" tab for apps the user had not interacted with for longer than 90 days</li>
<li>Click the ""View &amp; Edit"" button on the expired app</li>
<li>Click ""Renew Access"" in the popup</li>
</ul>

<p>Once I'd done all those steps my test user (and integration tests) worked again.</p>

<p>You have two options: </p>

<p>1) Refer to the Angular 5 documentation. (As @r-richards notes - change the version of the docs to v5 in the dropdown at the bottom of the left nav.)</p>

<p>2) Upgrade your project to Angular 6 to fix the issue</p>

<p><strong>Follow the official Angular upgrade guide.</strong> </p>

<p>You'll fill out a short form selecting which version of Angular you are on and which version you want to upgrade to. It then shows you the list of necessary steps to take to perform the upgrade. You should follow this guide for all upgrades. (Please upvote before navigating away) :)</p>

<p><strong>Here are some notes I took while upgrading from Angular 5 to Angular 6.</strong> </p>

<p>Your mileage may vary depending on your configuration. I linked to a couple articles below that helped me. </p>

<p>Update npm (Node Package Manager)</p>

<pre><code>npm install npm@latest -g 
</code></pre>

<p>Upgarde node</p>

<p>For Windows and mac users, the easiest method is with the official Node installer. Or see the article below for linux/unix. </p>

<pre><code>https://nodejs.org/en/download/
</code></pre>

<p>Upgarde Angular CLI globally and locally</p>

<pre><code>npm install -g @angular/cli
npm install @angular/cli
</code></pre>

<p>Update package.json</p>

<pre><code>ng update @angular/cli
</code></pre>

<p>Update @Angular/Core</p>

<pre><code>ng update @angular/core
</code></pre>

<p>Update Angular Material if you're using it</p>

<pre><code>ng update @angular/material
</code></pre>

<p>Check for other packages that may need to be upgraded</p>

<pre><code>npm outdated
</code></pre>

<p>Update all outdated packages</p>

<pre><code>npm update
</code></pre>

<p>Or to upgrade a specific package</p>

<pre><code>npm update &lt;package name&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>You may need to convert the angular-cli.json file to angular.json</p>

<pre><code>ng update @angular/cli --migrate-only --from=1.7.4
</code></pre>

<p>It seems that the root account uses a new password hashing method:</p>

<pre><code>&gt; select User,Host,plugin from user where User=""root"";
+------+-----------+-----------------------+
| User | Host      | plugin                |
+------+-----------+-----------------------+
| root | localhost | caching_sha2_password |
+------+-----------+-----------------------+
</code></pre>

<p>...but I don't know why Node.js is unable to connect to it. I have updated all the npm packages and it's still an issue.</p>

<p>I would like to keep the new password hashing method. Can I still make this connection work? Do I have to wait for an update of the MySQL Node.js package, or change a setting on my side?</p>
","<p>MySQL 8.0 uses a new default authentication plugin - <a href=""https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.0/en/sha256-pluggable-authentication.html"" rel=""noreferrer"">caching_sha2_password</a> - whereas MySQL 5.7 used a different one - <a href=""https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/5.7/en/native-pluggable-authentication.html"" rel=""noreferrer"">mysql_native_password</a>. Currently, the community Node.js drivers for MySQL don't support compatible client-side authentication mechanisms for the new server plugin.</p>

<p>A possible workaround is to alter the type of user account to use the old authentication plugin:</p>

<pre><code>ALTER USER 'root'@'localhost' IDENTIFIED WITH mysql_native_password BY 'MyNewPass';
</code></pre>

<p>Or create a different one that uses that same plugin:</p>

<pre><code>CREATE USER 'foo'@'localhost' IDENTIFIED WITH mysql_native_password BY 'bar';
</code></pre>

<p>There's a <a href=""https://github.com/mysqljs/mysql/pull/1962"" rel=""noreferrer"">pull request</a> in pipeline to properly address the issue.</p>

<p>Another option is to use the <a href=""https://www.npmjs.com/package/@mysql/xdevapi"" rel=""noreferrer"">official</a> MySQL Node.js connector (full disclosure: I'm the lead dev), which is based on the <a href=""https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.0/en/document-store.html"" rel=""noreferrer"">X Protocol</a> and already supports the new authentication mode.</p>

<p>Expected output of alternate sorting:</p>

I tried slicing out the Math.max.apply(null,arr) and Math.min.apply(null,arr) alternatively to push into separate empty array. But It was told that the algorithm is not optimal.</p>
","<p>I would sort the array, and then iterate it, <strong>picking values from the begining and the end</strong> (inloop calculated offsets), in each iteration. A final check to odd arrays would complete the process.</p>

a.sort((a, b) =&gt; a - b);
let b =[];
    
let l = a.length-1;  // micro optimization
let L = l/2;         // micro optimization
for(var i=0; i&lt;L; i++) b.push( a[l-i] ,a[i] );
if(a.length%2) b.push( a[i] ); // add last item in odd arrays

<p>Result : </p>

</code></pre>

<p>Algorithm bennefits: </p>

<ul>
<li>Avoiding alterations in the original array (through <code>pop</code> and <code>shift</code>), improves the performance considerably.</li>
<li>Precalculating <code>l</code> and <code>L</code> before the loop , prevents the need of being calculated repeatedly in each iteration.</li>
<li>A single conditional cheking at the end of the procces, to handle odd arrays,  slightly improves the speed.</li>
</ul>

","<p>I had the same problem.</p>

<p>They problem here is that You override the items slot including <code>&lt;tr&gt;</code> tag. Without that everything will work fine. But for me, that was not a solution so if You want to override the <code>&lt;tr&gt;</code> tag also, <strong>add :key to it, like this: <code>&lt;tr :key=""props.index""&gt;</code></strong>.
Take a look at source of v-data-table <a href=""https://github.com/vuetifyjs/vuetify/blob/dev/src/components/VDataTable/mixins/body.js#L46"" rel=""noreferrer"">here</a>.
To be honest, i don't know why it make that big difference but in my case that resolved the problem (i suspect that it is connected with vue list rendering).</p>

<p>example from the book Accelerated C++ written by Andrew Koening:</p>

<pre><code>while(c != cols){
    if(r == pad + 1 &amp;&amp; c == pad + 1){
      cout &lt;&lt; greet;
      c+=greet.size();
    } else {

      if(r == 0 || r == rows - 1 || c == 0 || c == cols - 1)

      else

        ++c;


    }

  }
</code></pre>

<p>The prefix increment of c is executed regardless of whether r=0 or not but I dont understand why.</p>

<p>If the if statement turns true an asterisk is printed. IF not a blank space is printed and c is incremented. 
Thats how I am reading it but c gets incremented regardless of what the values of r or c are.</p>

<p>This is what it says in the book but theres no explanation I could find:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Notice how the different indentation of
  ++c;
   draws attention to the fact that it is executed regardless of whether we are in the
  border.</p>
</blockquote>
","<p>Whitespace does not affect C++ runtime behavior. (Unlike certain other languages, like Python).</p>

<p>I should mention that in your <code>else</code> block, you do not use braces.  So, only the first statement (<code>cout &lt;&lt; "" "";</code>) will be part of the <code>else</code> clause.  The subsequent <code>++c;</code> will execute regardless of the value of <code>r</code> and <code>c</code>.</p>

<p>Note that this last point is subjective, so take it with a grain of salt...  As you can see, when braces are omitted from <code>if ... else ...</code> blocks, there is potential for confusion.  Some would argue that it leads to more concise code, but many (including myself) would argue that you should always use braces.  This is especially important when you work on a large team because code tends to grow over time.  I've seen many cases in production code where an <code>if</code> statement was missing the braces and someone added a second line to the <code>if</code> clause without remembering to add braces.  This didn't work as expected and caused wasted time debugging fails, just because the braces were omitted.</p>

","<p>Floating-point operations are defined by IEEE754 with numeric applications in mind and, by default, round to the nearest representable value in a very strictly-defined manner.</p>

<p>Integer operations in computers are <em>not</em> defined by general international standards.  The operations granted by languages (especially those of the C family) tend to follow  whatever the underlying computer provides.  Some languages define certain operations more robustly than others, but to avoid excessively difficult or slow implementations on the available (and popular) computers of their time, will choose a definition that follows its behaviour quite closely.</p>

<p>For this reason, integer operations tend to <em>wrap around</em> on overflow (for addition, multiplication, and shifting-left), and <em>round towards negative infinity</em> when producing an inexact result (for division, and shifting-right).  <strong>Both of these are simple <em>truncation</em> at their respective end of the integer</strong> in two's-complement binary arithmetic; the simplest way to handle a corner-case.</p>

<p>Other answers discuss the relationship with the remainder or modulus operator that a language might provide alongside division.  Unfortunately they have it backwards.  <strong>Remainder depends on the definition of division, not the other way around</strong>, while modulus can be defined independently of division - if both arguments happen to be positive and division rounds down, they work out to be the same, so people rarely notice.</p>

<p>Most modern languages provide either a remainder operator or a modulus operator, rarely both.  A library function may provide the other operation for people who care about the difference, which is that remainder retains the sign of the dividend, while modulus retains the sign of the divisor.</p>

<p>I can not figure out why this happens. Cordova-platform is Version 6.3.0.</p>

<li><p>Manipulated <code>gradle.build</code> within the platform, as recommended in other stackoverflow-questions. </p></li>

<p>If the result of the sql query is </p>

<pre><code>67, 'some name', 1, 'some name in table 2', 67
</code></pre>

<p>Then everything is OK and I have <code>[(&lt;Table1&gt;, &lt;Table2&gt;)]</code>  for table1_table2_tuple_list </p>

<p>But 
If the result of the sql query is: (also all other code is for this result)</p>

<pre><code>67, 'some name', Null, Null, Null
</code></pre>

<p>Then instead of receiving <code>[(&lt;Table1&gt;, None)]</code> 
I receive <code>[(None, None)]</code></p>

<pre><code>sql = text('SELECT t1.*, t2.id, t2.name,t1.id FROM table1 t1 '
               'LEFT JOIN table2 t2 ON t1.id=t2.table1_id ')

<p>Then I receive:</p>

<pre><code>[&lt;Table1&gt;, &lt;Table2&gt;, 1]
</code></pre>

<p>But in this case I'm not even sure if this is correct because I match two columns from the sql to model Table2 that has three columns. Not sure at all why this is working, but everything seems on place. Still is not what I want, because I don't want to return to this query and to specify again and again new columns if there are such for Table2</p>

<p>What I need is a way to select from two tables with pure sql , and to match the result to my models. Also I want to have result even in the cases when one of the tables doesn't have value in it's result columns. Hope I am clear. My goal is to receive </p>

<pre><code>[(&lt;Table1&gt;, None)]
</code></pre>

<p>when the query is for all colums (<code>SELECT t1.*, t2.*</code>) and there is LEFT JOIN with null added.</p>
","<p>The problem is that your tables have columns with the same names. SqlAlchemy after executing your query tries to match resulting columns by names (not by positions) and choose some matching which fits (in this case SA matched columns of table2 with fields of Table1 and vice versa). There is a way to specify matching with <a href=""http://docs.sqlalchemy.org/en/latest/core/sqlelement.html#sqlalchemy.sql.expression.TextClause.columns"" rel=""noreferrer"">.columns() method</a> but I would suggest you to consider using <a href=""http://docs.sqlalchemy.org/en/latest/orm/tutorial.html#querying"" rel=""noreferrer"">orm-functions</a> of SqlAlchemy instead whenever possible unless you have strong reasons against it.</p>

<p>It is an extreme pain to debug this because the command prompt displaying the error will not pause but close almost immediately.</p>

<p><a href=""https://stackoverflow.com/questions/50393103/pyinstaller-not-finding-pandas-hook"">Similar issues</a></p>

<p><strong>Looking for Suggestions</strong>
I am hoping for suggestions to troubleshoot Pyinstaller. Any resources to read up on would be nice.
Usually, I have no trouble with python as Pycharm has several handy debugging tools that will help me identify the problem</p>
","<p>I ran into the same problem and found this thread, but I managed to solve it borrowing from the <a href=""https://stackoverflow.com/questions/47318119/no-module-named-pandas-libs-tslibs-timedeltas-in-pyinstaller"">reference you posted</a> (about <code>pandas._libs.tslibs.timedeltas</code>), so thank you for that!</p>

<p>In that article, the module that resulted in the <code>ImportError</code> was, in fact <code>pandas._libs.tslibs.timedeltas</code>, if you look at the poster's logs. But the error you and I ran into refers to <code>np_datetime</code> instead. So, from the traceback logs, I finally figured out that the code we have to write in <code>hook-pandas.py</code> should be the following:</p>

<pre><code>hiddenimports = ['pandas._libs.tslibs.np_datetime']
</code></pre>

<p>Maybe that alone will solve your problem, <strong>HOWEVER</strong>, in my case, once I solved the <code>np_datetime</code> issue, other very similar <code>ImportError</code> problems arose (also related to hiddenimports regarding pandas), so, in case you run into the same issues, just define <code>hiddenimports</code> as follows:</p>

<pre><code>hiddenimports = ['pandas._libs.tslibs.np_datetime','pandas._libs.tslibs.nattype','pandas._libs.skiplist']
</code></pre>

<p><strong>TL;DR:</strong></p>

<p>You can first try to write </p>

<pre><code>hiddenimports = ['pandas._libs.tslibs.np_datetime']
</code></pre>

<p>into <code>hook-pandas.py</code>. However, if for some reason you run into the exact same issues I did afterwards, try</p>

<pre><code>hiddenimports = ['pandas._libs.tslibs.np_datetime','pandas._libs.tslibs.nattype','pandas._libs.skiplist']
</code></pre>

<p>If you wish to dive deeper (or run into a different pandas <code>ImportError</code> than the ones I did), this is the code in pandas's <code>__init__.py</code> referenced in your traceback log (lines 23 to 35):</p>

<pre><code>from pandas.compat.numpy import *

try:
    from pandas._libs import (hashtable as _hashtable,
                             lib as _lib,
                             tslib as _tslib)
except ImportError as e:  # pragma: no cover
    # hack but overkill to use re
    module = str(e).replace('cannot import name ', '')
    raise ImportError(""C extension: {0} not built. If you want to import ""
                      ""pandas from the source directory, you may need to run ""
                      ""'python setup.py build_ext --inplace --force' to build ""
                      ""the C extensions first."".format(module))
</code></pre>

<p>From that I went into the </p>

<p>C:\Python27\Lib\site-packages\pandas_libs</p>

<p>and</p>

<p>C:\Python27\Lib\site-packages\pandas_libs\tslibs</p>

<p>folders and found the exact names of the modules that resulted the errors.</p>

<p>I hope that solves your problem as it did mine.</p>

<p>Cheers!</p>

<p>Tried all the option of downgrading and upgrading prettier version.</p>

I mentioned this in the comment below but for some reason people still refer to the same thing. </p>

<h2>Please note that this is a hack... A temporary one at that. But it's meant for people who want to get their work done right now... While waiting for a permanent fix to ship. As you might have guessed... A PR has already been submitted and already been merged. Which means a fix is coming within the next release. In the meantime... This will do. And yes when that release comes in it will override this hack and none of this would seem to have happened. Cheers</h2>

<p>Dont even bother to downgrade.
Its a minor issue.
I gave an explanation and <a href=""https://stackoverflow.com/questions/50555943/running-into-couldnt-infer-parser-error-using-vue-cli/50565355#50565355"">what worked for me here:</a>
In a nutshell:
Go to:
 <code>node_modules\vue-loader\lib\template-compiler</code> ...open <code>index.js</code> and look for </p>

<p><code>// prettify render fn
    if (!isProduction) {
      code = prettier.format(code, { semi: false})
    }</code></p>

<p>and change the lines to:</p>

<pre><code>// prettify render fn
if (!isProduction) {
  code = prettier.format(code, { semi: false, parser: 'babylon' })
}
</code></pre>

<p>Thats it!</p>

","<p>TLDR: You have to manually inflate the graph, add the keys/values to the defaultArgs, and set the graph on the <code>navController</code>. </p>

<p><strong><em>Step 1</em></strong></p>

<p>The documentation tells you to set the graph in the <code>&lt;fragment&gt;</code> tag in your <code>Activity</code>'s layout. Something like:</p>

<pre><code>&lt;fragment
    android:id=""@+id/navFragment""
    android:name=""androidx.navigation.fragment.NavHostFragment""
    app:graph=""@navigation/nav_whatever""
    app:defaultNavHost=""true""
    /&gt;
</code></pre>

<p><em>REMOVE the line setting the <code>graph=</code>.</em></p>

<p><strong><em>Step 2</em></strong></p>

<p>In the Activity that will be displaying your <code>NavHostFragment</code>, inflate the graph like so:</p>

<pre><code>val navHostFragment = navFragment as NavHostFragment
val inflater = navHostFragment.navController.navInflater
val graph = inflater.inflate(R.navigation.nav_whatever)
</code></pre>

<p>Where <code>navFragment</code> is the id you gave your fragment in XML, as above.</p>

<p><strong><em>Step 3 [Crucial!]</em></strong></p>

<p>Create a bundle to hold the arguments you want to pass to your <code>startDestination</code> fragment and add it to the graph's default arguments:</p>

<pre><code>val bundle = Bundle()
// ...add keys and values
graph.addDefaultArguments(bundle)
</code></pre>

<p><strong><em>Step 4</em></strong></p>

<p>Set the graph on the host's <code>navController</code>:</p>

<pre><code>navHostFragment.navController.graph = graph

<p>Final:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>""final"" means single-assignment: a final variable or field <em>must</em> have an initializer. Once assigned a value, a final variable's value cannot be changed. final modifies <em>variables</em>.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Const:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>""const"" has a meaning that's a bit more complex and subtle in Dart. const modifies <em>values</em>. You can use it when creating collections, like const [1, 2, 3], and when constructing objects (instead of new) like const Point(2, 3). Here, const means that the object's entire deep state can be determined entirely at compile time and that the object will be frozen and completely immutable.</p>
  
  <p>Const objects have a couple of interesting properties and restrictions:</p>
  
  <p>They must be created from data that can be calculated at compile time. A const object does not have access to anything you would need to calculate at runtime. 1 + 2 is a valid const expression, but new DateTime.now() is not. </p>
  
  <p>They are deeply, transitively immutable. If you have a final field containing a collection, that collection can still be mutable. If you have a const collection, everything in it must also be const, recursively. </p>
  
  <p>They are <em>canonicalized</em>. This is sort of like string interning: for any given const value, a single const object will be created and re-used no matter how many times the const expression(s) are evaluated. In other words: </p>

So I tried to protect cout with a mutex.</p>

<p>The following code starts 10 background threads with std::async. When a thread starts, it prints  ""Started thread ..."".
The main thread iterates over the futures of the background threads in the order in which they were created and prints out ""Done thread ..."" when the corresponding thread finished.</p>

<p>The output is synchronized correctly, but after some threads have started and some have finished (see output below), a deadlock occurres. All background threads left and the main thread are waiting for the mutex.</p>

<p>What is the reason for the deadlock?</p>

<p>When the print function is left or one iteration of the for loop ends, the lock_guard should unlock the mutex, so that one of the waiting threads would be able to proceed. </p>

<p>Why are all the threads left starving? </p>

<pre><code>#include &lt;future&gt;

   //retrieve and print the value stored in the future
   for (auto &amp;f : futures) {
      lock_guard&lt;mutex&gt; g(mtx);
      cout &lt;&lt; ""Done thread"" &lt;&lt; f.get() &lt;&lt; ""("" &lt;&lt; this_thread::get_id() &lt;&lt; "")"" &lt;&lt; endl;

</code></pre>
","<p>Your problem lies in the use of <code>future::get</code>:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Returns the value stored in the shared state (or throws its exception)
  when the shared state is ready.</p>
  
  <p>If the shared state is not yet ready (i.e., the provider has not yet
  set its value or exception), the function blocks the calling thread
  and waits until it is ready.</p>
</blockquote>

<p><a href=""http://www.cplusplus.com/reference/future/future/get/"" rel=""noreferrer"">http://www.cplusplus.com/reference/future/future/get/</a></p>

<p>So if the thread behind the future didn't get to run yet, the function blocks until that thread finishes. However, you take ownership of the mutex before calling <code>future::get</code>, so whichever thread you're waiting for will not be able to attain the mutex for itself.</p>

<p>This should fix your deadlock problem:</p>

<pre><code>int value = f.get();
lock_guard&lt;mutex&gt; g(mtx);
cout &lt;&lt; ""Done thread"" &lt;&lt; value &lt;&lt; ""("" &lt;&lt; this_thread::get_id() &lt;&lt; "")"" &lt;&lt; endl;

When you define a variable as <code>volatile</code>, you tell the compiler to avoid optimizing that variable. Can we use the two approaches interchangeably? And if so what are the pros and cons? Below are some pros and cons that I can think of. Are there any more?</p>

<p><strong>Pros:</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>Using the <strong>-O0</strong> flag is helpful if we have a big code base inside which the variables that should have been declared as <code>volatile</code>, are not. If the code is showing buggy behavior, instead of going in the code and finding which variables need to be declared as volatile, we can just use the <strong>-O0</strong> flag to eliminate the possibility that optimization is causing the problem.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Cons:</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>The <strong>-O0</strong> flag will affect the entire code while the <code>volatile</code> keyword only affects a specific variable. If we're working on a small microcontroller for example, this could be a problem since using <strong>-O0</strong> may produce a big executable.</li>
</ul>
","<p>The short answer is: the <code>volatile</code> keyword does <em><strong>not</strong></em> mean ""do not optimize"". It is something completely different. It informs the compiler that the variable may be changed by something which is not visible for the compiler in the normal program flow. For example:</p>

<ol>
<li>It can be changed by the hardware - usually registers mapped in the memory address space</li>
<li>Can be changed by the function which is never called - for example the interrupt routine</li>
<li>Variable can be changed by another process or hardware - for example shared memory in the multiprocessor / multicore systems</li>
</ol>

<p>The volatile variable has to be read from its storage location every time it is used, and saved every time it was changed.</p>

<p>Here you have an example:</p>

<pre><code>int foo(volatile int z)
{
    return z + z + z + z;
}

int foo1(int z)
{
    return z + z + z + z;    
}
</code></pre>

<p>and the resulting code (-O0 optimization option)</p>

<pre><code>foo(int):
  push rbp
  mov rbp, rsp
  mov DWORD PTR [rbp-4], edi
  mov edx, DWORD PTR [rbp-4]
  mov eax, DWORD PTR [rbp-4]
  add edx, eax
  mov eax, DWORD PTR [rbp-4]
  add edx, eax
  mov eax, DWORD PTR [rbp-4]
  add eax, edx
  pop rbp
  ret
foo1(int):
  push rbp
  mov rbp, rsp
  mov DWORD PTR [rbp-4], edi
  mov eax, DWORD PTR [rbp-4]
  sal eax, 2
  pop rbp
  ret
</code></pre>

<p>The difference is obvious I think. The volatile variable is read 4 times, non volatile is read once, then multiplied by 4.</p>

<p>In the most cases if the program does not run when you turn on the compiler optimization, you have some hidden UBs in your code. You should debug as long as needed to discover all of them. The correctly written program must run at any optimization level.</p>

<p>Bear in mind that `volatile' <strong>does not</strong> mean or guarantee the coherency &amp; atomicity.</p>

// convert the `keyup` event into an observable stream
Observable.fromEvent(this.el.nativeElement, 'keyup')

<p>This is my code for the RxJs5 version in Angular 6: (it doesnt work)</p>

<pre><code>Observable.fromEvent(this.el.nativeElement, 'keyup')

        .pipe (

Re-download dependencies and sync project (requires network)&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;The state of a Gradle build process (daemon) may be corrupt. Stopping all Gradle daemons may solve this problem.

<p>I refer to this issue as a <em>bug</em> rather than an <em>error</em> because I am still able to build my projects in Visual Studio and deploy them to my development device without errors or warnings from the build output. This might seem alright to ignore for a bit, but over time it has become an issue because my intellisense is underlining it in red as an error </p>

<p><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/0Lk6H.jpg"" alt=""a""> </p>

<p>every time I reference attributes from the <strong>Resource</strong> class. As you might guess, I refer this class a lot and the Visual Studio editor eventually becomes cluttered with these ""errors"" which (a) hinders my ability to find actual errors in my code and (b) irritates me beyond all reason...</p>

<h2>""Error"" Investigation</h2>

<ul>
<li>As shown in the last image, intellisense is picking up an <em>""Ambiguous Reference""</em> to each attribute in the <strong>Resource</strong> class. When I check my <strong>Resource.Designer.cs</strong> file I only see one reference, but get a second error</li>
</ul>

<p><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/YqXxg.jpg"" alt=""b"">.</p>

<ul>
<li>It is now telling me that that a <em>""Member with the same name is already declared""</em>. This lead me to believe that there is a second <strong>Resource.Designer.cs</strong> file, but my solution explorer and windows explorer both show only one.</li>
</ul>

<p><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/49bIB.jpg"" alt=""c""> </p>

<h2>Attempted solutions</h2>

<ul>
<li>Changed the namespace from <strong>InventoryApp</strong> (the default namespace of the file) to <strong>InventoryApp.Resources</strong>. This rid me of the ghastly errors but, upon building the project, it reverts the namespace in the file back to it's default, and the errors pop back up. I was also told by somebody who knows better that this is a big no-no.</li>
<li>Deleted the <strong>Resource.Designer.cs</strong> file, deleted the ""obj"" and ""bin"" folders from the project, cleaned and rebuilt the solution, then added the new <strong>Resource.Designer.cs</strong> file back to my solution. This did nothing to solve the problem.</li>
<li>Created an entirely new project from scratch. Even after creating a Blank Android App from the Visual Studio templates, the error persists. This begs the question: <strong>Is this a problem with my installation of Xamarin.Android?</strong></li>
</ul>

<h2>Side-notes</h2>

<ul>
<li>The <strong>Resource.Designer.cs</strong> file's Build Action is set to ""Compile""</li>
<li><p>The <strong>.csproj</strong> config file contains the tags:</p>

<pre><code>&lt;AndroidResgenFile&gt;Resources\Resource.Designer.cs&lt;/AndroidResgenFile&gt;

  <p>Thanks to @davidbauduin over at Xamarin Forums for this information.</p>
</blockquote>

<hr>

<p>I believe I have figured out the underlying issue and have a viable solution.</p>

<h2><strong>Solution</strong></h2>

<p>Add the following to the <code>&lt;PropertyGroup&gt;</code> section in your .csproj file:</p>

<pre><code>&lt;AndroidUseManagedDesignTimeResourceGenerator&gt;False&lt;/AndroidUseManagedDesignTimeResourceGenerator&gt;
</code></pre>

<h2><strong>Reason</strong></h2>

<p>While previous versions of Visual Studio had that feature turned off by default,  the latest VS2017 update (15.7.3) has it turned on.  That feature generates a second Resources.Designer.cs file that results in the ambiguous reference issue.</p>

<p>You can verify by hovering over the resource constant with the Intellisense error, right-clicking, selecting ""Go To Definition"", and selecting the 1st item, which takes you to a Resource.Designer.cs file.  If you repeat, but select the 2nd one, you'll be taken to a different Resource.Designer.cs file.  One of these points to the obj\Debug\designtime\Resource.Designer.cs file.  By setting that feature to False as described above, that Resource.Designer.cs file in the obj\Debug\designtime path will not be generated.</p>

<h2><strong>Information Regarding the AndroidUseManagedDesignTimeResourceGenerator Feature:</strong></h2>

I tried to search in android development documentation to understand the difference between these two databases, but i couldn't clearly understand. 
I did not find any answer in stack overflow either. 
I also want to know the benefit of using Room persistence compared to SQLite database. </p>

<p>Hope someone can give me clear answer. </p>
","<p>Room is an ORM, Object Relational Mapping library. In other words, Room will map our database objects to Java objects.
Room provides an abstraction layer over SQLite to allow fluent database access while harnessing the full power of SQLite.</p>

<p>Difference between SQLite and Room persistence library:-</p>

<ul>
<li>In case of SQLite, There is no compile time verification of raw SQLite queries. But in Room there is SQL validation at compile time.</li>
<li>As your schema changes, you need to update the affected SQL queries manually. Room solves this problem.</li>
<li>You need to use lots of boilerplate code to convert between SQL queries and 
Java data objects. But, Room maps our database objects to Java Object without boilerplate code.</li>
<li>Room is built to work with LiveData and RxJava for data observation, while SQLite does not.</li>
</ul>

<p>Room annotations and main components:</p>

<ol>
<li>@Entity — Define our database tables</li>
<li>@DAO — Provide an API for reading and writing data</li>
<li>@Database — Represent a database holder</li>
</ol>

<p>Here is the <a href=""https://medium.com/mindorks/sqlite-made-easy-room-persistence-library-ecd1a5bb0a2c"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">link</a> to the medium article which explains in detail the usage and benefits of Room persistence library.
I hope this helps.</p>

<p><strong>Edit 1:</strong> You can refer to Google developer docs, which clearly explains how to save data in a local database using room. <a href=""https://developer.android.com/training/data-storage/room/"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Link to Google Developer Docs</a></p>

<p>I'am quite confused how to fix that issue. Thanks in advance.</p>
","<p>Try this:</p>

<p>Remove the firebase import statement from App.js:</p>

<pre><code>import firebase from 'firebase'
</code></pre>

<p>On Firebase initialization create a constant:</p>

<pre><code>initializeFirebase() {
  const firebase = require(""firebase"");

  // Initialize Firebase
  var config = {
  ...
  };
  firebase.initializeApp(config);

  //inicializando o firestore
  const firestore = require(""firebase/firestore"");
  db = firebase.firestore();
  db.settings({ timestampsInSnapshots: true });
}

componentWillMount() {
  this.initializeFirebase();
...
}

<p>To me this workaround works very well!</p>
